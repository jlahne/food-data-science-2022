  abstract = {The aims of the present two studies were to delineate a portrait of people who are attracted to magical beliefs about food and health and to study the self-reported functions for the beliefs. Participants were Finnish men and women ranging in age from 15 to 66 years (N=3261 in study 1 and N=189 in study 2), and they filled in either an Internet-based or a paper questionnaire. The believers were more often women than men, vegetarians than omnivores, and they relied more on alternative medicine, thought in a more intuitive way, and demonstrated more eating-disordered thinking than the nonbelievers. Additionally, the believers had experienced slightly more negative life events than the nonbelievers in study 1 but contrary to our hypothesis, they did not differ in their desire for control. The believers reported value-expressive function as the most important one served by their beliefs, followed by the control and utilitarian functions. The emotional, intuitive nature of food beliefs and their connection to values and identity are discussed.},

In the second part, I will argue that the applied field of sensory evaluation stresses the importance of using ecologically valid, naturalistic stimuli. Sensory evaluation also provides results that challenge accepted interpretations in psychology, especially in the field of evaluation of expertise.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new method called DISTATIS that can be applied to the analysis of sorting data. DISTATIS is a generalization of classical multidimensional scaling which allows one to analyze 3-ways distance tables. When used for analyzing sorting tasks, DISTATIS takes into account individual sorting data. Specifically, when DISTATIS is used to analyze the results of an experiment in which several assessors sort a set of products, we obtain two types of maps: One for the assessors and one for the products. In these maps, the proximity between two points reflects their similarity, and therefore these maps can be read using the same rules as standard metric multidimensional scaling methods or principal component analysis. Technically, DISTATIS starts by transforming the individual sorting data into cross-product matrices as in classical MDS and evaluating the similarity between these matrices (using Escoufier's RV coefficient). Then it computes a compromise matrix which is the best aggregate (in the least square sense, as STATIS does) of the individual cross-product matrices and analyzes it with PCA. The individual matrices are then projected onto the compromise space. In this paper, we present a short tutorial, and we illustrate how to use DISTATIS with a sorting task in which ten assessors evaluated eight beers. We also provide some insights into how DISTATIS evaluates the similarity between assessors.},

  abstract = {When used to analyze brain imaging data, pattern classifiers typically produce results that can be interpreted as a measure of discriminability or as a distance between some experimental categories. These results can be analyzed with techniques such as multidimensional scaling (MDS), which represent the experimental categories as points on a map. While such a map reveals the configuration of the categories, it does not provide a reliability estimate of the position of the experimental categories, and therefore cannot be used for inferential purposes. In this paper, we present a procedure that provides reliability estimates for pattern classifiers. This procedure combines bootstrap estimation (to estimate the variability of the experimental conditions) and a new 3-way extension of MDS, called DISTATIS, that can be used to integrate the distance matrices generated by the bootstrap procedure and to represent the results as MDS-like maps. Reliability estimates are expressed as (1) tolerance intervals which reflect the accuracy of the assignment of scans to experimental categories and as (2) confidence intervals which generalize standard hypothesis testing. When more than two categories are involved in the application of a pattern classifier, the use of confidence intervals for null hypothesis testing inflates Type I error. We address this problem with a Bonferonni-like correction. Our methodology is illustrated with the results of a pattern classifier described by O'Toole et al. (O'Toole, A., Jiang, F., Abdi, H., Haxby, J., 2005. Partially distributed representations of objects and faces in ventral temporal cortex. J. Cogn.

Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the pca model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. Pca can be generalized as correspondence analysis (ca) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (mfa) in order to handle heterogenous sets of variables. Mathematically, pca depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (svd) of rectangular matrices.},

PLS methods proceed by deriving latent variables which are (optimal) linear combinations of the variables of a data table. When the goal is to find the shared information between two tables, the approach is equivalent to a correlation problem and the technique is then called partial least square correlation (PLSC) (also sometimes called PLS-SVD). In this case there are two sets of latent variables (one set per table), and these latent variables are required to have maximal covariance. When the goal is to predict one data table the other one, the technique is then called partial least square regression. In this case there is one set of latent variables (derived from the predictor table) and these latent variables are required to give the best possible prediction. In this paper we present and illustrate PLSC and PLSR and show how these descriptive multivariate analysis techniques can be extended to deal with inferential questions by using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and permutation tests.},

  abstract = {The Institute of Food Technologists' (IFT) success skills highlight the importance of developing professional skills in the food science curriculum. On the other hand, many students in higher education report that the public school system feels disconnected and unrelated to their future. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate student's perceived importance of professional skills, as well as to enhance their awareness and confidence in them. Students in a sensory science class at the University of Illinois completed a questionnaire at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester to assess their opinion of and self-assurance in professional skills, such as writing technical reports, providing leadership, making formal presentations, and applying critical thinking. During the semester, students received basic training and guidelines on each skill and were given assignments and activities to practice them as part of their coursework. Results showed increased knowledge about the existence of IFT core competencies, as well as an increased motivation to practice success skills regularly. They also showed an increased perceived importance of presentation skills, leadership, dealing with group conflict, researching scientific information, and library resources. Confidence in 80\% of the skills increased significantly by the end of the semester, after students had been presented with opportunities to practice and discuss the skills in groups. Students were also able to relate their learning of specific success skills to different course assignments. This study concluded that a general exposure to the importance of practicing professional skills in a college setting enhanced student's experiences and awareness by connecting them to their future professional careers.},

The respondents were presented with 16 photographs of a traditional cheese from their respective countries, varying according to six factors: pasteurisation, organic production, omega-3, packaging, price and appropriateness. For each of the scenarios the consumers indicated their willingness to buy the cheese on a nine-point scale. Results show that consumers' willingness to buy traditional cheese is highly driven by price, appropriateness and pasteurisation in both countries. However, on average consumers in the French sample prefer buying raw milk cheese, while consumers in the Norwegian sample prefer buying pasteurised cheese. These general trends are led by a pro-raw milk segment in France and a pro-pasteurised milk segment in Norway. Several interaction effects involving appropriateness are detected, indicating the importance of the consumption context on the acceptance of innovations in traditional cheese. On a general level, the results indicate that well-accepted innovations in traditional cheese are those that reinforce the traditional and authentic character of the product.},

  abstract = {Sensory experiences play an important role in consumer response, purchase decision, and fidelity towards food products. Consumer studies when launching new food products must incorporate physiological response assessment to be more precise and, thus, increase their chances of success in the market. This paper introduces a novel sensory analysis system that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER), galvanic skin response (GSR), and cardiac pulse to determine consumer acceptance of food samples. Taste and smell experiments were conducted with 120 participants recording facial images, biometric signals, and reported liking when trying a set of pleasant and unpleasant flavors and odors. Data fusion and analysis by machine learning models allow predicting the acceptance elicited by the samples. Results confirm that FER alone is not sufficient to determine consumers\&rsquo; acceptance. However, when combined with GSR and, to a lesser extent, with pulse signals, acceptance prediction can be improved. This research targets predicting consumer\&rsquo;s acceptance without the continuous use of liking scores. In addition, the findings of this work may be used to explore the relationships between facial expressions and physiological reactions for non-rational decision-making when interacting with new food products.},

  abstract = {The response variable of overall liking is often used to measure consumers' overall hedonic response to food. However, little research is done to understand, if liking of all four sensory modalities; appearance, odour, taste and texture, are reflected in the evaluation of overall liking, or if a single sensory modality stands out and is of most importance. The term sensory satisfaction was recently introduced as an alternative to overall liking and should (at least in theory) be used by consumers as a more holistic response variable than overall liking. The aim of the analyses reported in the present paper were, to study the importance of the sensory modalities (liking of appearance, odour, taste and texture) in consumers' evaluation of overall liking and compare the findings to the importance of the sensory modalities (liking of appearance, odour, taste and texture) in consumers' evaluation of sensory satisfaction. The data came from a cross-over consumer case-study on apple-cherry fruit drinks (n = 67). The fruit drinks varied in: type of sweetener used, and addition of aroma and fibre. The modalities driving overall liking and sensory satisfaction were studied through slopes of a regression line relating overall liking and sensory satisfaction, respectively, to liking of the sensory modalities: liking of appearance, -odour, -taste and -texture. Results showed the steepest slope between overall liking and liking of taste, whereas the least steep slope was found for liking of odour. The same pattern between slopes was found for sensory satisfaction and overall liking. Therefore, it was concluded that consumers primarily paid attention to liking of taste (to be understood as flavour) and least attention to liking of odour, when evaluating overall liking and sensory satisfaction, respectively, and that consumers did not use sensory satisfaction as a more holistic response variable than overall liking.},

Here, individual characteristics according to bitter food consumption patterns were assessed. The study included 2327 participants in the SU.VI.MAX antioxidant-based randomized controlled trial (1994\textendash 2002). The sample was drawn from the general French population. Dietary data were obtained from a minimum of twelve 24-h dietary records provided during the first 2 years of follow-up. Two bitter food consumption scores were computed \textendash{} one assessing the variety of items consumed (unweighted score) and the other reflecting exposure to bitterness estimated via complementary sensory panel data from the EpiPref project (weighted score). Associations with sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors were analyzed with multiple linear regression. Among men, the variety of bitter foods consumed was positively associated with educational level and alcohol intake and inversely associated with physical activity and rural area of residence. Among women, the same outcome was positively associated with alcohol intake and inversely associated with diabetes. In turn, Body Mass Index displayed a significant inverse association with the bitterness-weighted score across sex, whereas educational level was supported only in women. This study adds to the presently scant knowledge about non-genetic determinants or moderators of actual bitter food intake. Future studies should elucidate the impact of diabetes and body size on bitter food intake patterns.},

The aromatic composition was mainly constituted by fusel alcohols and ethyl esters. Among the minor volatile compounds, fatty acids, volatile phenols, and alcohols were the main components. The olfactometric analysis revealed the existence of 55 aromatic areas, exhibiting a wide range of intensities. Components like amyl alcohols, 2-phenylethanol, ethyl esters such as 2-methylbutyrate, hexanoate and octanoate, hexanoic and octanoic acids 2-phenylethyl acetate, 4-ethyl guaiacol, and 4-ethyl phenol could be considered as being part of the structure of cider aroma. The extract dilution analysis of one extract identified 2 volatile phenols (4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-ethyl phenol) among the most powerful odorants in cider. These components gave significant correlations with the sensory attributes sweet, spicy, and lees.},

In attribute selection it is desirable to reduce the list of those to be presented to panelists to avoid fatigue, minimize costs and save time. In some applications the goal is to keep attributes that are relevant and non-redundant in the sensory characterization of products. In this paper, however, we are interested in keeping attributes that best discriminate between products. For that we present a data mining-based method for attribute selection in descriptive sensory panels, such as those used in the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. The proposed method is implemented using Principal Component Analysis and the k-Nearest Neighbor classification technique, in conjunction with Pareto Optimal analysis. Objectives are (i) to identity the set of attributes that best discriminate samples analyzed in the panel, and (ii) to indicate the group of panelists that provide consistent evaluations. The method is illustrated through a case study where beef cubes in stew, used as combat ration by the American Army, are characterized in sensory panels using the Spectrum protocol.},

The items were tested in an online format in three empirical studies (n = 560), and participants were recruited through MTurk. Exploratory factor analyses and item analysis were conducted to confirm the psychometric characteristics of the item pool. Overall, five distinct domains of food meanings emerged: moral, sacred, health, social, and aesthetic. Each dimension of food meaning was associated with different dietary intake outcomes, providing evidence for criterion validity. Further, each dimension of food meaning displayed associations with psychologically similar, yet distinct constructs from the literature in a manner concordant with the theoretical specifications of each construct, providing further validity evidence. The strong associations between the different domains of food meanings and behavioral outcomes suggest that this construct may be an important and clinically relevant aspect of people's relationship to food which has heretofore lacked systematic investigation.},

During sourdough fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce a number of metabolites which have been shown to have a positive effect on the texture and staling of bread, e.g. organic acids, exopolysaccharides (EPS) and/or enzymes. EPS produced by LAB have the potential to replace more expensive hydrocolloids used as bread improvers. Organic acids affect the protein and starch fractions of flour. Additionally, the drop in pH associated with acid production causes an increase in the proteases and amylases activity of the flour, thus leading to a reduction in staling. While improving the textural qualities of bread, sourdough fermentation also results in increased mineral bioavailability and reduced phytate content. In this review we will be discussing the effect of sourdough on wheat and rye bread as well as the potential of sourdough to improve the quality of gluten-free bread.},

A survey of the plain yogurt market was performed, followed by a semiotic analysis of the gathered labels performed by a team of semiotics experts. Only the non-verbal elements such as images, visual structure, colors, typography and their combinations, were considered; so brand, price, nutritional information, composition, etc. were nor taken into consideration. The main messages conveyed by the labels were summarized and based on that, five yogurt model labels were designed and subsequently used as stimuli in a consumer study. An online consumer questionnaire, based on a word association task, was performed in both countries to understand the words, descriptions, associations, thoughts or feelings generated by the model labels. The approach was successful, and the results obtained showed that the main messages conveyed by the model labels were well understood in Spain and Uruguay; however some cultural differences in the perception of the messages could be highlighted.},

Considering that wellbeing is one of the most important goals that people pursue to achieve a good life, studying the influence of food on this construct can contribute to our understanding of how eating behavior patterns are shaped. The conceptualization of wellbeing and the influence of specific food products on different aspects of this construct are expected to vary with consumers' cultural background. The present work aimed to investigate cross-cultural differences in perceived wellbeing of food products and to link those differences to product-specific consumer evaluations. A web-based study was carried out with 1332 participants in seven countries on four continents: Brazil, China, France, Portugal, Spain, Uruguay and USA. Nine food concepts (apple, beef, beer, broccoli, chocolate cake, coffee, fish, French fries and milk) were presented to participants by means of an incomplete balanced design. For each concept, participants gave their degree of agreement with 31 statements of a new wellbeing questionnaire, using a 7-point scale. The scores of the 31 items of the scale were significantly affected by country and food concept, as well as through their interaction. The largest differences among products were found for items related to physical and intellectual aspects of wellbeing, whereas the largest differences among countries were found for items related to emotional and spiritual aspects. Results from this research provide insights for measuring consumers' perception of the influence of foods on wellbeing and highlight the importance of taking into account cultural differences in the conceptualization of this construct.},

In this context, apart from health and sensory characteristics, non-sensory factors such as packaging might have a key role on determining consumers' purchase decisions regarding functional foods. The aims of the present work were to study the influence of different package attributes on consumer willingness to purchase regular and functional chocolate milk desserts; and to assess if the influence of these attributes was affected by consumers' level of involvement with the product. A conjoint analysis task was carried out with 107 regular milk desserts consumers, who were asked to score their willingness to purchase of 16 milk dessert package concepts varying in five features of the package, and to complete a personal involvement inventory questionnaire. Consumers' level of involvement with the product affected their interest in the evaluated products and their reaction towards the considered conjoint variables, suggesting that it could be a useful segmentation tool during food development. Package colour and the presence of a picture on the label were the variables with the highest relative importance, regardless of consumers' involvement with the product. The importance of these variables was higher than the type of dessert indicating that packaging may play an important role in consumers' perception and purchase intention of functional foods.},

Also, the samples were evaluated by a panel of trained assessors. Consumers' descriptions of the samples were mainly related to hedonic and sensory characteristics of the milk desserts. The elicited terms provided information about which are the attributes that drive consumers' preferences using their own language. Multiple factor analysis was used to obtain a synthetic map of the samples based on consumers' descriptions, sensory data and overall liking scores. This methodology could be an interesting technique to select the most relevant attributes for consumers and to study the relationship between sensory data and consumers descriptions.},

  abstract = {Interest in methodologies for sensory product characterization by consumers is increasing, and check-allthat-apply questions (CATA or checklists) have gained some popularity. This research studied bias pertaining to: (i) the order in which sensory attributes are placed within a CATA question, and (ii) the order of a sensory CATA question within an extended product assessment ballot (including product-elicited emotions, purchase intention and overall liking). In three studies including 335 consumers and using fresh fruit as samples, evidence of attribute order bias was established. In each study, two ballot versions were used in a between-subjects design. Primacy effects linked to attribute salience could explain some of the results. For example, differences in frequency of use of an attribute would be higher on the ballot version where it was placed nearer to the top of the list. However, this type of bias was not sufficient to explain all observed effects. It was found that a random ordering of sensory attributes in a CATA question reduced the total frequency of usage of terms compared with when attributes were grouped with similar terms (e.g. flavour/taste terms grouped together and texture terms grouped together). Some evidence was obtained to suggest that listing sensory attributes in the order that approximate the time when they would be perceived during the course of consuming the sample is necessary unless consumers are given explicit instructions to recall all sensory perceptions and evaluate attributes on the list from that point of reference. It was also found that conclusions regarding differences between samples depended on which ballot version was used. Few order effects were uncovered when the sensory CATA question was prior to or subsequent to other product evaluations (product-elicited emotions and purchase intention). There was no significant effect on hedonic scores of the tested products linked to the attribute order within the sensory CATA question. This research can help to inform best practices in the design of CATA questions for sensory product characterization.},

  abstract = {As the use of check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions for consumers to aid sensory product characterization gains popularity the need for developing guidelines regarding best practice increases. An important issue in the design of studies including CATA questions is the number of consumers that are necessary to obtain stable results. In this context, the aim of the present work was to study the stability of sample and descriptor configurations obtained using CATA questions with consumers, by means of a bootstrapping resampling approach. Data from 13 consumer studies were analyzed, differing in number of consumers, product category, number of samples, degree of difference among samples and number and type of descriptors in the CATA question. For each study, 1000 random subsets of different number of consumers were generated from the original data set. For each consumer virtual panel, sample and descriptor configurations were obtained using Correspondence Analysis and the concordance between them and the reference configurations (obtained with all the consumers) were computed using the regression vector (RV) coefficient. The RV coefficients of sample and descriptor configurations increased with the number of consumers, suggesting an increase in the stability of the configurations. Results showed that the number of consumers necessary to yield fully stable configurations depended on the degree of difference among samples, the complexity of the sensory space and the type of descriptors included in the CATA question. Across the 13 data sets analysed, results suggested that when working with widely different samples, 60\textendash 80 consumers can be regarded as a reasonable compromise to get stable sample and descriptor configurations. However, it is recommended to check, a posteriori, the stability of sample and descriptor configurations using a stability index based on bootstrapping.},

In this article we examine the impact of this dynamic decision process on individuals,\"A\^o choices and satisfaction with their outcomes. We propose that choices reflect a balancing of two classes of goals: goals that are strictly individual and goals that are triggered by the existence of the group. The latter sometimes results in choices that undermine personal satisfaction and increase regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in which we tracked consumers,\"A\^o orders of dishes and drinks. In the Lunch study we found that real groups (tables) choose more varied dishes than would be expected by random sampling of the population of all individual choices across all tables. The Beer study demonstrates that this group,\"A\^elevel variety seeking is attributable to the interaction,\"A\^iimplicit or explicit,\"A\^iamong group members, and can be dissipated when the group is forced to ,\"A\'udisband,\"A\`u and its members make strictly individual choices.

The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP libraries (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Specific annotations provided include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German, French, and Spanish.},

In recent decades food historians have tended to emphasize the cultural factors in consumption, in addition to the already well-established social, political and economic perspectives, but what is still missing is the stuff in foodstuffs. With reference in particular to milk and wine, the suggestion here is that physical and chemical composition is a major influence in what we might call the biographies of particular items of food and drink. Product characteristics are rarely static for long and today's mass-produced bread is different from that of the past, but then so are the flour, the yeast, and the even the butter that is spread on it. Adulteration was a particularly interesting aspect of composition in the nineteenth century and was the key to the emergence of two different traditions of understanding and valuing food quality.},

According to the view outlined here, the act of eating allows the different qualities of foodstuffs to be combined into unified percepts; and flavor can be used as a term to describe the combination of tastes, smells, trigeminal, and tactile sensations as well as the visual and auditory cues, that we perceive when tasting food.},

Nevertheless, some types of verbalization seem to facilitate the sharing of an olfactory experience. The experiment reported here was aimed at gaining a better understanding of how successful oral communication in the domain of olfaction works. It was hypothesized that oral description of odors enhances the recognition of olfactory stimuli that match the description. The experimental situation involved two participants, one of whom (sender) smelled and orally described an odorant to the other person (receiver) who had to recognize it. Qualitative analyses (verbal) from the communication phase and quantitative analyses (recognition rate) from the recognition phase were made. The line of study of the participants (18 chemistry students and 18 humanities students) and the type-of-odorant used had no effect on the recognition rate. On the other hand, as the number of trials increased, a slight but still statistically significant interaction between participant sex and odor-recognition rate was observed. The qualitative analysis showed that the oral communication revolved mainly around five types of description - known source, odor intensity, hedonistic valence, odorant property, and odorant effect \textendash and that the use of too many of these descriptors reduces performance. Descriptions were based on associations and fuzzy categories, they were related to the body, occasionally contained references to other senses (sight, touch, and taste), and could exhibit considerable self-confidence, even on trials that ended in a recognition failure. These findings support the idea that one and the same scent-bearing substance can be subject to highly diverse cognitive processing.},

  abstract = {The existence of a Chardonnay wine concept was explored in two experiments. In the first experiment, 28 Chardonnay wine experts assessed in terms of a score the degree of representativeness of 48 white wines according to their own Chardonnay wine concept. The samples were 29 wines made from Chardonnay grapes and 19 wines made from other grape varieties (Aligote, Melon de Bourgogne, Sylvaner, Sauvignon blanc, Chenin, Marsanne and Pinot blanc). Two assessment conditions were conducted: orthonasal and global (orthonasal plus retronasal and mouthfeel perceptions). Globally, scores were higher for Chardonnay wines than for non-Chardonnay ones and the consensus among experts demonstrated the existence of a shared Chardonnay wine sensory concept. The global evaluation led to a better discrimination between Chardonnay and non-Chardonnay wines, indicating that the sensory concept includes olfactive as well as taste and mouthfeel sensations. In the second experiment, the perceptive similarities of a subset of 18 wines (nine among the less representative and nine among the most representative) were studied. Twenty consumers freely sorted the wines according to odour similarity. Results were analysed by means of multidimensional scaling. Except for an extreme wine exhibiting very low representativeness, no clear separation of wines according to a Chardonnay wine concept was observed on the MDS space. However, a regression analysis showed significant correlations between representativeness scores and the first and third dimensions of the MDS space. This suggests that the Chardonnay wine concept is an experts' construct, elaborated by specific weighing of sensory features, partially based on perceptive similarities. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This study explores the differences in wine categorization between wine experts and novice wine consumers using 10 Melon de Bourgogne (MB) and 10 Chardonnay (CH) wines. Participants performed a free sorting task based on odor similarity followed by a CH and a MB typicality rating task and a liking rating. All tasks were performed orthonasally. We observed a clear agreement between experts concerning typicality scores. Moreover, despite a slight overlap we found a clear differentiation between CH and MB for experts' typicality scores. For novices, no such agreement on typicality scores was observed and we found a complete overlap between both types of wines. These results suggest that experts developed through successive wine tasting separate consensual sensory concepts for CH and MB wines. Multidimensional Scaling analyses of the sorting tasks showed an expertise effect since the expert similarity plot showed a better separation between MB and CH wines than the novices' one. For experts, significant correlations between both CH and MB typicality scores and the MDS first dimension coordinates suggest that experts' CH and MB sensory concepts are partially based on perceptual similarities. Additionally, experts' hedonic scores were significantly correlated with their CH typicality scores as well as with the MDS second dimension. This correlation suggests that liking was involved in the sorting task but was not the main expert's criteria to sort the wines. Our results suggest that wine expertise may be more of a cognitive expertise rather than a perceptual one.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The use of minerality as a wine descriptor has increased in the last few years. Minerality always suggests high quality and evokes a link between wine and the soil. The sensory meaning of minerality, however, is not yet clearly understood. The present study was designed to understand how wine experts conceptualise minerality and to explore whether they can judge wine minerality in a consensual way. Methods and Results Experts carried out an orthonasal free sorting task on 16 Chardonnay wines. Afterwards, they rated their mineral character according to two conditions: orthonasally and on the palate while wearing a nose-clip. The experts also answered a questionnaire in which they defined minerality. A trained panel independently performed a sensory description of the samples. The wine experts showed strong disagreement in their minerality judgements under both conditions. Three groups of experts emerged for each condition. Each group considered as mineral wines with quite different sensory characteristics which prevents any generalisation concerning the sensory meaning of minerality. Surprisingly, definitions of minerality by the experts showed some commonality despite the use of idiosyncratic terms. Conclusions Minerality is an ill-defined sensory concept, despite the apparent consistency emerging from verbal definitions by the experts. Significance of the Study Minerality is nowadays a popular term in wine marketing. Some attempts to understand its chemical origin have been made; however, this study has shown that a sensory definition of minerality should first be developed.},

The story of Unicum is the story of the Zwack family, who has owned the company since the end of the 18th century (except for the 40 year period when it was nationalized by the Communists). Dr. Zwack, a physician for the Imperial Court of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy, is credited with creating the drink to alleviate the royal family's digestion problems. But it didn't take long for the drink to take hold on the rest of the country. The Zwack family--headed by Peter Zwack--runs the company today--which also produces high-end palinka, wine, and other types of liquor. So, what is Unicum? It's a thick, black, goopy concoction, made from more than 40 herbs and spices. The exact composition is a carefully guarded family secret which was stored in a safe deposit box in New York during the Communist era. Part of the mixture is macerated for thirty days in water, while the other part is distilled. Then, in a process that has remained almost unchanged for more than 200 years, both are blended and aged in oak casks for six months.},

Embeddedness perspectives and conventions theory are suggested as fruitful avenues for understanding why labels of origin present a challenge to conventional agriculture. These theoretical perspectives also shed light on how origin labeled products administered by the state impact rural development through the processes of negotiation they engender. The French AOC request process is outlined and aspects of it analyzed in more detail to demonstrate how it opens market forms of justification to larger arenas of social scrutiny.

Forty-two percent of women who had no educational qualifications were in the lowest quarter of the food involvement score, compared with 12\% of women with degrees. Women with lower scores on the food involvement scale also reported eating fruit and vegetables less often. The odds of eating fewer fruit and vegetables rose with lower educational attainment and with lower food involvement scores, suggesting that each has an independent effect. We have shown that the Food Involvement scale discriminates between women, is associated with other characteristics and predicts dietary quality. We now plan to use it in a larger, representative population of women of lower educational attainment to examine its role along with other psychological variables in determining dietary quality.},

In particular, we experiment with synonyms in the field of nautical terminology. Our results indicate that AVMI is very good at spotting synonym couples among pairs of unrelated terms (with precision close to 90\% at 62.5\% recall) and that it outperforms more standard methods based on contextual cosine similarity. However, AVMI is not able to distinguish between synonyms and other semantically related terms. Thus, AVMI can be used for synonym mining only if it is combined with techniques to filter out other semantic relations.},

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.},

Here we address the parallel challenges linked to measurement of flavor and human preferences, particularly as it applies to a complex, whole food in which many chemicals and sensations are synthesized into a distinct and recognizable flavor profile. What is flavor? What contributes to the pleasure evoked by flavors? We examine interactions between taste and olfaction as well as psychophysical measurement limitations that confound efforts to understand human flavor preferences. The ability to address these questions in a whole food presents exciting opportunities to understand the basic principles of how we select the foods that we eat.},

We argue these labels often refer to experiences of different absolute intensity to the groups of interest making the comparisons invalid.

  abstract = {Labeled scales are commonly used for across-group comparisons. The labels consist of adjective/adverb intensity descriptors (e.g., ``very strong''). The relative distances among descriptors are essentially constant but the absolute perceived intensities they denote vary with the domain to which they are applied (e.g., a ``very strong'' rose odor is weaker than a ``very strong'' headache), as if descriptors were printed on an elastic ruler that compresses or expands to fit the domain of interest. Variation in individual experience also causes the elastic ruler to compress or expand. Taste varies genetically: supertasters perceive the most intense tastes; nontasters, the weakest; and medium tasters, intermediate tastes. Taste intensity descriptors on conventional-labeled scales denote different absolute perceived intensities to the three groups making comparisons across the groups invalid. Magnitude matching provides valid comparisons by asking subjects to express tastes relative to a standard not related to taste (e.g., supertasters match tastes to louder sounds than do nontasters). Borrowing the logic of magnitude matching, we constructed a labeled scale using descriptors unrelated to taste. We reasoned that expressing tastes on a scale labeled in terms of all sensory experience might work. We generalized an existing scale, the Labeled Magnitude Scale (LMS), by placing the label ``strongest imaginable sensation of any kind'' at the top. One hundred subjects rated tastes and tones using the generalized LMS (gLMS) and magnitude matching. The two methods produced similar results suggesting that the gLMS is valid for taste comparisons across nontasters, medium tasters, and supertasters.},

Bartlett's test of sphericity gave X2~=~9043.49 (p~\&lt;~0.001), while the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index was 0.87 (KMO were 0.89 for women and 0.83 for men). The test-retest reliability of the IES-2 was 0.88 for the IES-2 total score. The IES-2 had a~=~0.82.

The wines were then paired with a single Cheddar cheese and the consumers asked to rate ``ideal'' pairings and indicate hedonic liking of the pairs. A descriptive analysis (DA) panel of seven judges evaluated the sensory properties of the wines before and after consumption of the cheese. DA indicated that consumption of the Cheddar cheese before tasting the wine had similar sensory effects on all the wines including a reduction of flavour length and astringency intensity, while the tannin quality became silkier. All wines dominated the cheese flavour but the wine that dominated the cheese flavour the most was the least liked pairing, while the wine that dominated the cheese second most was the most liked pairing. Only nine of the wines, but all of the wine and cheese pairs were liked by the consumers. Two of the top three most preferred Shiraz and cheese pairings were those containing wines that scored highest in quality and were most liked by the wine industry experts and consumers. In contrast, the two least liked wine and cheese pairs included the wines that scored poorly on quality and were not liked. Wine domination of the cheese does not appear to drive the preference for wine and cheese pairs; rather it appears driven by overall preference for the wine alone.},

Recently, this interest has been reinvigorated by the availability of genotyping technologies (e.g., microarrays) that provide new genetic data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs\textemdash which represent pairs of nucleotide letters (e.g., AA, AG, or GG) found at specific positions on human chromosomes\textemdash are best considered as categorical variables, but this coding scheme can make difficult the multivariate analysis of their relationships with behavioral measurements, because most multivariate techniques developed for the analysis between sets of variables are designed for quantitative variables. To palliate this problem, we present a generalization of partial least squares\textemdash a technique used to extract the information common to 2 different data tables measured on the same observations\textemdash{} called partial least squares correspondence analysis\textemdash that is specifically tailored for the analysis of categorical and mixed (``heterogeneous'') data types. Here, we formally define and illustrate\textemdash in a tutorial format\textemdash{} how partial least squares correspondence analysis extends to various types of data and design problems that are particularly relevant for psychological research that include genetic data. We illustrate partial least squares correspondence analysis with genetic, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Verbalization can be used as a complement in a sorting task (also known as categorization). Assessors are required to describe each item or group of items using their own words; thus, a ``labeled'' categorization is performed. In cross-cultural studies, several panels may use different languages. We propose to extend hierarchical multiple factor analysis (HMFA) to compare panels from, simultaneously, both categorization and verbalization tasks, even when the latter is performed in several languages. We present this methodology through a study where both a Catalan and French panels performed a labeled categorization on a set of eight Catalan wines. Either Catalan or French is used by the panelists. HMFA allows for comparing the two panels not only globally but also from either the categorization or the verbalization tasks. Although results show a noticeable similarity between both configurations of wines as defined by the panels, textual data highlight interesting differences or viewpoints between Catalan and French. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Cross-cultural studies are increasing in sensory studies, frequently including verbalization that can be performed in different languages. We propose a methodology to tackle the data issued from this kind of studies, including categorical and multilingual textual data. Our application concerns two panels, Catalan and French, who have performed a labeled sorting task, although more panels could be considered. The application shows that textual data nuance the similarities put to the fore between both configurations of wines as defined by the panels. Furthermore, this application uncovers that important concepts in the wine world are not always shared by panels issued from different backgrounds. No translation is required before the treatment.},

They contribute to a better understanding of the consumers' likes and willingness, important factors to the food industry. A prime objective of this paper is to give a global vision of the scientific publications in food science related to this topic from their abstracts. Textual statistics, combining multidimensional methods such as correspondence analysis, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables and characteristic words, are proving to be useful for extracting information from the corpus of abstracts. These abstracts have evolved over time towards a higher concern for research about methodology, which has become more complex and requires sophisticated statistical methods. Sensory methods, such as free choice profile, flash profile, repertory grid, sorting task, napping, word association and CATA, have emerged or have been revitalised. New statistical methods, such as multiple factor analysis, have been introduced to analyse data issued from verbalisation tasks. However, correspondence analysis, a reference method for dealing with texts and, more generally, frequency tables, is used with too much restraint.},

Analysis of variance yielded significant main effects of both eating setting and of group size, indicating that meal durations were longest in the moderately priced restaurant and shortest in the fast-food restaurant.

Although ``homeostatic'' mechanisms that adjust intake to bodily needs do exist in humans as in other animals, the importance of non-homeostatic, mainly hedonistic, influences is much greater in humans. Several psychological characteristics of humans, in addition to their particular social and economic circumstances, play a decisive role in their responses to foods. Given the obesity epidemic that has recently emerged in developed societies, the specific study of factors that determine food ingestion in humans has become particularly urgent. Validated questionnaires and research methods have been developed to investigate the complex interactions of these factors.},

Beyond the protection of the use of their name, which is the founding principle of this system, and the legal and economic considerations this system implies, new questions are being raised about these products concerning the diversification of farming and sustainable development. More and more, and in a favourable context, another major issue is becoming apparent: the biological and cultural diversity linked to these products. This questioning concerns the status and the future of these local resources in our societies and whether or not GIs can help maintain this diversity. Protecting local and traditional products through the GI system can contribute to conserving biodiversity at various levels: domestic animal breeds, plant varieties, microbial ecosystems, and landscapes. This is also a way of maintaining in a formal way shared knowledge and practices, since they underpin the protected resource. Taking account of these elements offers an opportunity to think about agriculture differently and leads us to propose an innovative approach to local products. Several examples taken in France will help show how links can be established between the protection of GI, cultural biodiversity, and local knowledge.},

This paper examines the flavor profile, a novel sensory evaluation method developed by chemists at Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL), the storied Cambridge, MA consulting firm. Introduced in 1949, the flavor profile claimed to offer a reliable way of measuring and describing the subjective sensory qualities of products. Drawing extensively on archival material, I document the circumstances surrounding the development of the flavor profile at ADL, examine its uses, and consider the conditions that led to its widespread adoption by the food industry. By considering the flavor profile as both a scientific instrument for flavor measurement, and a practical tool for flavor design and development, I hope to illuminate a dark corner in the history of food industrialization: the values, ideologies, and contingencies that shaped how foods were made to taste in the postwar period.},

The methods are flexible and can be used for both aggregated data (averages) of multiple products and raw data of one or more products. Breiman's RF and Johnson's methods can be used for both the data sets with more observations than variables and the data set with more variables than observations, which is the typical situation in sensory panel descriptive analysis data. The LMG and Breiman's RF methods are applicable to both continuous attributes and categorical (including binary) attributes.

We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. Methods We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6~men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey~(16~g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. Results In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8\% of participants. There were no diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge, participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed. Conclusions In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS placed diets low in FODMAPs. www.anzctr.org.au.

The analysis focuses on two school curricula that are vying to teach children ``where food comes from.'' I argue that the ``food'' in these two curricula is not the same thing. Within the Food, Inc. Discussion Guide, food is connection, responsibility, and politics. The Alliance to Feed the Future curricula respond with a strategic anti-politics of food, asserting that food can only be ``what it obviously is'' and framing Real Food's challenge as scientific and technical ignorance.},

Many variables involved in the fermentation process contribute to cider fragrance, but their relative impact on the finished odor remains ambiguous, because there is little consensus on the most efficient method for cider volatile analysis. Herein, we have optimized and applied a headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography\&ndash;mass spectrometry (HS-SPME GC-MS) method for the chemical analysis of cider VOCs. We determined that the 30 min exposure of a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber at 40 \&deg;C yielded detection of the widest variety of VOCs at an extraction efficiency \&gt;49\% higher than comparable fibers. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we utilized this method to profile cider aroma development throughout the fermentation process for the first time. The results yielded a very practical outcome for cider makers: a pre-screening method for determining cider quality through the detection of off-flavors early in the fermentation process. The aroma profile was found to be well established 72 h after fermentation commenced, with major esters varying by 18.6\% \&plusmn; 4.1\% thereafter and higher alcohols varying by just 12.3\% \&plusmn; 2.6\%. Lastly, we analyzed four mature ciders that were identically prepared, save for the yeast strain. Twenty-seven key VOCs were identified, off-flavors (4-ethylphenol and 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol) were detected, and odorants were quantified at desirable concentrations when compared to perception thresholds. VOCs varied considerably following fermentation with four novel strains of S. cerevisiae, evidencing the central importance of yeast strain to the finished cider aroma.},

Food choice capacity represented participants' confidence in meeting their standards for food and eating given their food management skills and circumstances. Standards (expectations for how participants felt they should eat) were based on life course events and experiences. Food management skills (mental and physical talents to keep food costs down and prepare meals) were sources of self-esteem for many participants. Most participants had faced challenging and changing circumstances (income, employment, social support, roles, health conditions). Participants linked strong food management skills with high levels of food choice capacity, except in the case of extreme financial circumstances or the absence of strong standards. Implications for Research and Practice Recognizing people's experiences and perspectives in food choice is important. Characterizing food management skills as durable, adaptive resources positions them conceptually for researchers and in a way that practitioners can apply in developing programs for adults.},

For each recall, participants described foods and beverages consumed, location, people present, thoughts and feelings, and activities occurring at that time. Analysis of verbatim transcripts of interviews identified 1448 eating and drinking episodes. Constant comparative analysis of participants' descriptions for episodes resulted in a conceptual framework that characterizes eating and drinking episodes as holistic and as having eight interconnected dimensions (food and drink, time, location, activities, social setting, mental processes, physical condition, recurrence). Each dimension has multiple features that can be used to describe the episodes. In recalling episodes, participants used conventional labels (e.g. ``dinner'') as well as modified-conventional labels (e.g. ``birthday dinner'') and uniquely constructed labels (e.g. ``unwind time''). Labels provided insights into the dimensions of the episodes. Results suggest approaches for researchers and practitioners who seek to understand how people manage everyday eating at a time when traditional meal patterns are changing.},

  abstract = {While the demand for non-alcoholic beer has increased, consumers often complain about its inferior sensory characteristics. As expectations mediate the effect of extrinsic product cues on sensory perception, we could utilise these cues to improve consumers' experience of such products. The current study, comprising four repeated measures experiments, investigated the role of extrinsic cues in generating sensory and hedonic expectations of beer. A hundred and sixty-six beer drinkers viewed realistic beer labels, which varied in their colour, design, labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor, in response to which they rated their expectations of bitterness, smoothness, sweetness, refreshment, beer colour, body and liking. In summary, across these four experiments, label colour, labelled alcohol content and sensory descriptor all had significant and replicable effects on consumer expectations. However, the size of these effects depended on how explicit or implicit the information of a cue was relative to the presence and specificity of other cues on the label. For example, red and brown labels increased expected bitterness (F(3,108) = 16.58, p {$<$} 0.001, {$\eta$}g2 = 0.102), but this effect decreased (F(1,38) = 7.92, p = 0.008, {$\eta$}g2 = 0.026) when labelled alcohol content was also manipulated and disappeared (F(1, 37) = 2.1, p = 0.156) when an explicit cue, a sensory descriptor, was added. Overall, the study provides new insights into how labelling shapes expectations, and illustrates the disproportionate influence of different extrinsic cues. Finally, the findings highlight the need to use realistic stimuli: the information different extrinsic cues carry and the way we combine them influences expectations.},

  abstract = {The evening meal is an important regular event in the lives of many people. Understanding how people cognitively construct evening meals can provide insight into social and behavioral processes that are used in food choice. Schema theory provided a framework to explore cognitive constructions as scripts that guide behavior for the evening meal. A grounded theory approach was used to explore participants' evening meal scripts. Qualitative interviews with 32 adults were conducted and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Analysis revealed that participants' evening meal scripts were guided and shaped by dominant values and general expectations about food and eating in this context. Evening meal scripts included sequentially ordered behaviors characterized as strategies providing a general guide for behaviors and procedures that include relatively specific details about how the behavior will occur within the context. Eight different kinds of scripts emerged from the analysis including Provider, Family Cook, Head of the table, Egalitarian, Struggler, Just eat, Anything goes, and Entertainer. The exploration of food choice scripts provides insight into links between cognitions and behaviors that may influence dietary intake. Future investigations should examine these scripts with different participants, in different settings, and for different eating contexts.},

Yet this same great flexibility requires researchers to make several (seemingly arbitrary) decisions in their designs, such as fixing a sufficient number of objects to sort, setting task requirements, and creating task instructions for participants. In the present research, we provide a systematic empirical investigation of the consequences of typical researcher design choices while administering sorting tasks. Specifically, we studied the effects of seven sorting task design factors by collecting data from over 1,000 online participants assigned to one of 36 sorting tasks, as part of a fractional factorial experimental design. Analyses show the effects of the various researcher decisions on the probability that participants would quit the task, the amount of time spent on the task, the number of piles made, and posttask measures such as satisfaction and depletion. Research design recommendations are provided.},

The sorting task is flexible in accommodating different instructions and has been used for decades in exploratory marketing research in brand positioning and categorization. However, no general analytic procedures yet exist for analyzing sorting task data without performing arbitrary transformations to the data that influence the results and insights obtained. This manuscript introduces a flexible framework for analyzing sorting task data, as well as a new optimization approach to identify summary piles, which provide an easy way to explore associations consumers make among a set of items. Using two Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of single-serving snacks from a local retailer, the authors demonstrate that the resulting procedure is scalable, can provide additional insights beyond those offered by existing procedures, and requires mere minutes of computational time.},

The assessment of global similarities between product configurations showed that the same key sensory concepts were identified in both cultures. Specificities were also identified in each culture. Free sorting task results suggest that compared to French subjects, Vietnamese subjects adopted more similar strategies to sort the products. Flash profile results showed that Vietnamese subjects spontaneously used fewer attribute, and used them in a more similar way to rank the products. Concerning the methods, flash profile configurations were more similar to the conventional configuration than free sorting task configurations whatever the country.},

In France and in Vietnam, two panels independently generated, defined and used their own attributes to characterize the product set. In a second step, French and Vietnamese attributes were translated and transferred to two new panels respectively in Vietnam and in France. At a very global level of the analysis, the examination of the RV and NRV coefficients revealed important similarity between the two sensory profiles independently established in France and Vietnam. It also revealed that it was possible to translate and transfer attributes between the two countries with an important accuracy. At a finer level of the analysis, examining the data with Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) and taking the hierarchical structure of the data into account made it possible to reveal interesting features. First, for the panels using French attributes product scaling was more balanced between the first two axes whereas for panels using Vietnamese attributes, product scaling was more dominated by the opposition of the products on the first axis. Second, attribute transfer appeared to be slightly more efficient from France to Vietnam than from Vietnam to France. The latter point was discussed with regard to panels' performances.},

There are no equivalent concepts for sorting data. In particular, there is currently no way to clearly assess if the results given by a panel are stable. The main goal of this study is to introduce an indicator of stability of a sorting map, the RVb coefficient, and to assess its relevance. The calculation of the RVb is based on a resampling approach. The stability of sorting maps was assessed using the RVb coefficient on five data sets varying in terms of number of products (8\textendash 15) and number of evaluations (10\textendash 118). As hypothesized, the RVb coefficient increased with the number of evaluations, decreased with the complexity of the sensory task, and increased with the expertise level of the panelists (which significantly impacted both the repeatability and homogeneity). Therefore, the RVb coefficient was found to be a relevant indicator of stability. A strong recommendation for future sorting studies is to systematically check the stability of the sorting map after data was collected. This can easily be achieved with the RVb coefficient.},

Factors conceptualized as intrinsic to the child in this review include sensory processing, taste perception, neophobia, and temperament. The important extrinsic determinants of children's food acceptance which are reviewed include parental and peer modeling, the family food environment, infant feeding practices including breastfeeding and age at weaning, concurrent feeding practices including restriction, pressure to eat, prompting and reward, and the taste \& energy content of foods. Children's willingness to accept new foods is influenced by a wide range of factors that likely have individual and also interactive effects on children's willingness to taste, and then continue to eat, new foods. The literature lacks longitudinal and experimental studies, which will be particularly important in determining interventions most likely to be effective in facilitating children's acceptance of healthy foods.},

Despite those differences, dozens of state fair and other wine competitions determine winners' ribbons, medals, scores, and ranks by pooling the opinions of female and male judges. This article examines twenty-three blind wine tastings during which female and male judges scored more than nine hundred wines. Two-sample t-test results show that the gender-specific distributions of scores do have similar means and standard deviations. Exact p-values for two-sample chi-square tests show that the distributions of men's and women's scores are not significantly different, and exact p-values for likelihood ratio tests of Plackett-Luce model results show that the genders' preference orders are not significantly different. The correlation coefficient between women's and men's scores is weakly positive in 90 percent of the tastings. On that evidence, indications that the genders prefer different wines are difficult to detect. If such differences do exist, as the nonwine literature implies, the results of this analysis show that those differences are small compared to non-gender-related idiosyncratic differences between individuals and random expressions of preference. The potential for accept-a-false-null-hypothesis Type II error when pooling female and male judges' wine-related opinions appears to be small. (JEL Classifications: A10, C10, C00, C12, D12)},

While research has heavily focused on teaching strategies and instructional tools to improve students' learning in general chemistry, less focus has been given to assessments as a learning tool to improve students learning. Standardsbased grading (SBG) is a nontraditional assessment method that explicitly connects the learning course objectives with assessments and student grades. Provided with more than one opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of course objectives, students are evaluated on their level of achievement of these objectives. This article describes the implementation, outcomes, and challenges of SBG in a large enrollment nonmajors' general chemistry course. Evidence is presented regarding the use of SBG in chemistry from the evaluation of two semesters of students' assessment scores and a student opinion survey. Students appeared to use the structure of the SBG to pass the course at higher rates than previous semesters, demonstrated some metacognitive skills, and generally appreciated SBG as the assessment method in the course.},

This paper provides an overview of this topic by contrasting ways of assessing the validity of effect and causal indicators in structural equation models (SEMs). It also draws a distinction between composite (formative) indicators and causal indicators and argues that validity is most relevant to the latter. Sound validity assessment of indicators is dependent on having an adequate overall model fit and on the relative stability of the parameter estimates for the latent variable and indicators as they appear in different models. If the overall fit and stability of estimates are adequate, then a researcher can assess validity using the unstandardized and standardized validity coefficients and the unique validity variance estimate. With multiple causal indicators or with effect indicators influenced by multiple latent variables, collinearity diagnostics are useful. These results are illustrated with a number of correctly and incorrectly specified hypothetical models.},

It is in particular in situations of dispute that a need arises to explicate the grounds on which responsibility for errors is distributed and on which new agreement can be reached.

The article develops a grammar of such modes of justification, called orders of worth (grandeur), and argues that the human capacity for criticism becomes visible in the daily occurrence of disputes over criteria for justification. At the same time, it is underlined that not all social situations can be interpreted with the help of such a sense of justice, which resides on a notion of equivalence. Regimes of love, of violence or of familiarity are systematically distinct from regimes of justification.},

Drawing from current literature on persons and organizations, the concept of reputation is applied to food conceived as a social agent: Food reputation pertains to all the beliefs about a food object, its antecedents (i.e., its production effects) and its consequences (i.e., its consumption effects). Food Reputation Map (FRM) is a theoretical framework and a methodological tool encompassing six main areas (synthetic indicators) of food reputation, further articulated into 23 markers (specific indicators): they gauge people evaluative perception of a food's intrinsic characteristics, its effects on the context (e.g., during its production phase), and its effects on the individual (e.g., during its consumption phase). Two studies were conducted at the Italian national level on over three thousands participants (N1 = 2693; N2 = 585\textendash out of 1308 total participants). Multivariate statistical analyses are used to build FRM as a psychometric tool for measuring food reputation. In each of the two studies (first long, and then short FRM version), results of exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha allow to select the best items for each synthetic and specific indicator, on the basis of its factorial structure and internal consistency. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND Fungicide residues on fruit may adversely affect yeast during cider fermentation, leading to sluggish or stuck fermentation or the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is an undesirable aroma compound. This phenomenon has been studied in grape fermentation but not in apple fermentation. Low nitrogen availability, which is characteristic of apples, may further exacerbate the effects of fungicides on yeast during fermentation. The present study explored the effects of three fungicides: elemental sulfur (S0) (known to result in increased H2S in wine); fenbuconazole (used in orchards but not vineyards); and fludioxonil (used in post-harvest storage of apples). RESULTS Only S0 led to increased H2S production. Fenbuconazole ({$\geq$}0.2 mg L?1) resulted in a decreased fermentation rate and increased residual sugar. An interactive effect of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) concentration and fenbuconazole was observed such that increasing the YAN concentration alleviated the negative effects of fenbuconazole on fermentation kinetics. CONCLUSION Cidermakers should be aware that residual fenbuconazole (as low as 0.2 mg L?1) in apple juice may lead to stuck fermentation, especially when the YAN concentration is below 250 mg L?1. These results indicate that fermentation problems attributed to low YAN may be caused or exacerbated by additional factors such as fungicide residues, which have a greater impact on fermentation performance under low YAN conditions. ? 2016 The Authors.

In-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews conducted with 34 informants, 20 women and 14 men, just prior to marriage and again one year later were used to explore continuity and change in cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors relating to body weight and body image at the time of marriage, an important transition in the life course. Three major conceptual themes operated in the process of developing and enacting informants' body weight relationships with their partner: weight relevance, weight comparisons, and weight talk. Weight relevance encompassed the changing significance of weight during early marriage and included attracting and capturing a mate, relaxing about weight, living healthily, and concentrating on weight. Weight comparisons between partners involved weight relativism, weight competition, weight envy, and weight role models. Weight talk employed pragmatic talk, active and passive reassurance, and complaining and critiquing criticism. Concepts emerging from this investigation may be useful in designing future studies of and approaches to managing body weight in adulthood.},

GIs are place-based names (e.g., Champagne, Roquefort) that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. The GI for tequila was established by the Mexican government in 1974, making it the oldest GI, and one of the best-recognized, outside of Europe. Here, we examine the social, economic, and ecological impacts that the agave\textendash tequila industry has had on one community in tequila's region of origin, the town of Amatita\textasciiacute{} n. We show that persistent cycles of surplus and shortage of agave and changing production relations in the agave\textendash tequila industry have led to: (1) economic insecurity among farm households; (2) increased use of chemical inputs, at the expense of more labor-intensive cultivation practices; and (3) overall declines in fertilizer application, especially during periods in which there is a surplus of agave. We argue that the negative effects of the agave\textendash tequila industry on the local economy and environment are due to the failure of the GI for tequila to value the ways in which the terroir of tequila's region of origin have contributed to its specific properties. We conclude by using this case to discuss more generally the relationship between the protection of place-based products (known collectively as geographical indications) and social and environmental sustainability.},

  abstract = {Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comt\'e cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains ``touch down'' plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs.},

Yet important questions remain regarding how local and extra-local actors actively construct embedded markets and how networks exhibit both embedding and disembedding tendencies. I use qualitative data on a case study of Comt\'e cheese, an origin-labelled cheese produced in eastern France, to develop a more critical and precise analysis of what embeddedness means in the context of (localised) food systems. I demonstrate the importance of horizontal and vertical forms of embeddedness. The expansion of the market and the entry of extra-local actors into the chain put a strain on the proximity and close ties that have historically constituted the basis of the social embeddedness of the Comt\'e supply chain. The institutions that the Inter-professional Committee for Gruy\`ere from Comt\'e has developed, the support offered by the French state and the actors' shared belief in terroir are forms of vertical embeddedness that all act to re-embed the Comt\'e supply chain in its particular territory, even in the context of these destabilising forces.},

At the same time, as commodity chains become longer, more transnational, and increasingly complex, the linkages between national identity, global capitalism, and political and economic elites are evolving. In this article, we show how culture,\"A\^iexpressed in terms of national attachment and collective heritage,\"A\^iis a key means by which elites assert their power along global commodity chains. Specifically, we use the tequila commodity chain as a lens for analyzing how notions of patrimony, and the attendant reliance on the language of shared collective experience, are mobilized to forward corporate agendas in the global marketplace. Focusing on the interplay between global processes and local responses, we argue that the Mexican state and tequila companies promote notions of nationalness at the expense of the agave farmers, small-scale distillers, and communities where tequila is produced. We show how three central themes are part of this process: the protection of place, the maintenance of quality, and the defense of national interests. This article illustrates how new forms of national attachments are emerging under globalization by integrating an analysis of culture into commodity chain research.},

The aim of this article is to present a new protocol of data collection that allows the characterization of large sets of products. It has been named the Sequential Agglomerative Sorting task (SAS task). It is partially based on a combination of the two previous solutions. All products are presented to the participant in the form of subsets. The latter are agglomerated by means of prototypes defined by the participant herself/himself. Thus, it reveals sensory dimensions that are neither approximated at the panel level nor conditioned by predefined prototypes. In this article, we present all the steps of implementation of the SAS task. A first study designed to test the performance of the SAS task is also presented.},

  abstract = {The network approach to psychopathology is becoming increasingly popular. The motivation for this approach is to provide a replacement for the problematic common cause perspective and the associated latent variable model, where symptoms are taken to be mere effects of a common cause (the disorder itself). The idea is that the latent variable model is plausible for medical diseases, but unrealistic for mental disorders, which should rather be conceptualized as networks of directly interacting symptoms. We argue that this rationale for the network approach is misguided. Latent variable (or common cause) models are not inherently problematic, and there is not even a clear boundary where network models end and latent variable (or common cause) models begin. We also argue that focusing on this contrast has led to an unrealistic view of testing and finding support for the network approach, as well as an oversimplified picture of the relationship between medical diseases and mental disorders. As an alternative, we point out more essential contrasts, such as the contrast between dynamic and static modeling approaches that can provide a better framework for conceptualizing mental disorders. Finally, we discuss several topics and open problems that need to be addressed in order to make the network approach more concrete and to move the field of psychological network research forward.},

Programme reports were identified in the grey literature using online searching and cross-referencing to support the research aim. Programmes from 2000 to 2012 targeting adolescents aged 13\textendash 17 years were included. Results: A total of 19 peer-reviewed papers and four grey literature programmes met the search criteria. Interventions focused on practical cooking and/or food preparation skills and targeted younger adolescent age groups. Programmes were most commonly held in schools and community settings. The majority of programmes (n = 16/23) did not use a theoretical basis for their development. Programme evaluation encompassed the use of pre- and post-intervention questionnaires and focus groups. Only nine studies included a dietary behaviour-based outcome measure. Although 19 of the 23 studies reviewed reported positive changes related to the intervention, these did not include significant changes in diet quality or cooking frequency at home. Conclusions: Few existing adolescent food literacy programmes have demonstrated a positive impact on dietary behaviours to date. Adolescent target groups present unique challenges in programme development and delivery.

This study investigated the socio-demographic profile of consumers using local commercial box schemes, and investigated the barriers and motivations of customers. Crosssectional surveys using identical questionnaires were conducted in Montpellier, France and Nottingham, England. Box scheme users in both countries were primarily rather affluent professionals. The English reported access to local produce that has travelled less food miles (a more altruistic reason) to be the most important motive to purchasing from the box scheme, whereas the French stated quality of produce (a more hedonistic reason) to be key. Both countries ranked ecological commitment and access to organic food as the next most important influences on their participation. The findings reinforce the importance of food quality and pleasure for the French generally, although once this fundamental criterion has been fulfilled, French box scheme users appear equally motivated by contributing positively to the ecosystem. In England, the desire to eat out of season food was cited as the main barrier to making more sustainable food choices. Cost was an important obstacle to increasing consumption of food from sustainable sources in both countries.},

Our study, using interviews, aimed to uncover student responses to both the food they eat whilst abroad and to the food they have left behind. Many students criticised local English food as bland, fattening, and unhealthy; nevertheless, most showed an openness to new foods, trying not only local food but also dishes prepared by their international friends, but this sat alongside a strong attachment to their home country dishes. Eating together was a popular leisure activity, and food of the origin country or region was the most popular cuisine. Eating home country food offered emotional and physical sustenance; students felt comforted by familiar taste, and that their physical health was stabilised by the consumption of healthier food than was available locally. Despite acknowledgement of the importance of food to cultural identity and overall quality of life in the anthropology and nutrition literatures, there is a dearth of research into this aspect of the international student experience; this study, therefore, marks an important beginning. \ss{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-two genotypes grown at the Univ. of Georgia\textendash Tifton Campus were evaluated. Four retail commercial grape genotypes (Vitis vinifera and ``Concord'') were also evaluated for comparison. Panelists familiar with muscadine grapes used the hedonic general labeled magnitude scale (HgLMS, \textendash 100 = strongest disliking of any kind ever experienced, +100 = strongest liking of any kind ever experienced) to rate overall liking and the liking of appearance, flavor, pulp texture, and skin texture. Puncture testing was done to assess grape berry texture, and compositional attributes soluble solids and pH were also measured. The sensory results indicated that the grapes were variable with overall liking scores from 12.2 to 39.6. The factors highly correlated with overall liking scores were muscadine flavor, pulp and skin liking, while a significant negative correlation was found between skin liking and skin texture and mechanical texture measures. The muscadine grapes with the highest overall liking scores were Ga. 5-1-34 and Ga. 2-8-21. Principal component analysis confirmed that grapes with a thinner skin and a higher pH tended to group around overall liking and flavor points. These results indicate that even among panelists familiar with muscadine grapes, skin thickness is a negative characteristic. Breeding for thinner skins may be a positive step in muscadines gaining a more widespread appeal in the fresh fruit market.},

The proliferation of low-calorie and vegan ice creams in supermarkets provides an interesting test-case for how health, general liking, and psychological factors like halo effects and reactance contribute to product choice. In our study, 223 participants tasted three cinnamon-bun flavored ice cream samples: super-premium, vegan, and low-calorie. Participants were assigned to one of three conditions. Condition one received no information about the three ice creams. Condition two received photos of the product containers, the ingredients, and the nutrition labels. Condition three received the same product information as condition two, along with a warning about the health consequences of eating too much sugar and fat. After tasting each sample, participants rated how much they liked the sample and its perceived healthfulness, and then indicated the sample they preferred overall. Participants in all conditions believed that the vegan ice cream was healthier than the super-premium ice cream, providing evidence of a health halo effect. Participants ranked the super-premium ice cream as tasting the best across all conditions. Liking rating was the strongest predictor of overall ice cream preference as indicated by participants' preferred ice cream being the super-premium. The research findings have implications for nutrition educators and marketers, reinforcing that liking is a large driver of product choice, that health halos around vegan products exist, and that a text health warning does not dissuade people from choosing an indulgent option.},

Sensory properties of lettuce may vary in response to environmental factors that often fluctuate widely throughout the growing season. Bitterness is generally thought to increase in lettuce grown at higher temperatures and may be related to phenolic content. This study evaluated sensory properties and total phenolic content of 5 lettuce cultivars harvested early, midway, and late in the growing season and investigated possible correlations with environmental temperature and light intensity indexes. Thirty panelists rated bitterness, appearance, flavor, texture, and overall acceptability of ``Crisp and Green'' (green leaf), ``Crispino'' (crisphead), ``Green Forest'' (romaine), ``Lochness'' (butterhead), and ``Vulcan'' (red leaf) lettuce. There was considerable variation in sensory ratings among the 5 cultivars (P\hspace{0.6em}{$<$} 0.005) but few differences within cultivars across the growing season. The crisphead cultivar, Crispino, received higher scores (P\hspace{0.6em}{$<$} 0.01) for flavor, texture, and overall acceptability and was rated less bitter (P\hspace{0.6em}{$<$} 0.05) than other cultivars. Total phenolic content varied significantly (P\hspace{0.6em}{$<$} 0.001) among cultivars with the red leaf cultivar, Vulcan, exhibiting the highest levels. There was no correlation between bitterness and total phenolic content or environmental factors. Differences among lettuce cultivars appear to have a larger impact on sensory and phenolic profiles than environmental variation during the growing season.},

The aim of this study was to determine the role of gatekeepers' confidence in food-related skills and nutrition knowledge on food practices in the home. Methods: An online survey was completed by 1059 Australian dietary gatekeepers selected from the Global Market Insite (GMI) research database. Participants responded to questions about food acquisition and preparation behaviours, the home eating environment, perceptions and attitudes towards food, and demographics. Two-step cluster analysis was used to identify groups based on confidence regarding food skills and nutrition knowledge. Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVAs were used to compare the groups on the dependent variables. Results: Three groups were identified: low confidence, moderate confidence and high confidence. Gatekeepers in the highest confidence group were significantly more likely to report lower body mass index (BMI), and indicate higher importance of fresh food products, vegetable prominence in meals, product information use, meal planning, perceived behavioural control and overall diet satisfaction. Gatekeepers in the lowest confidence group were significantly more likely to indicate more perceived barriers to healthy eating, report more time constraints and more impulse purchasing practices, and higher convenience ingredient use. Other smaller associations were also found. Conclusion: Household food gatekeepers with high food skills confidence were more likely to engage in several healthy food practices, while those with low food skills confidence were more likely to engage in unhealthy food practices. Food education strategies aimed at building food-skills and nutrition knowledge will enable current and future gatekeepers to make healthier food decisions for themselves and for their families.},

  abstract = {In food science and technology, understanding off-flavors has a significance with both technical and commercial implications. In the food industry in the United States, it is a widely held truism that consumers will not buy a product if they do not like the way it tastes or if it contains unpleasant flavors. But how can science determine when food is off putting, and how do scientists learn to address bad tastes in their experimental and technical practice? Based on ethnographic work with food scientists in the United States, this paper is a reflexive account of learning to taste off-flavors, a form of sensory learning that utilizes the scientist's own body as a kind of instrument. The paper argues that a particular understanding of the consumer sensorium emerges through food scientists' approach to off-flavors. This is an image of the consumer as a chemically receptive sensory system that is highly sensitive to compounds at trace levels. By utilizing the sensitivity of their own senses, food scientists exploit the relationship between distaste, memory and sensory perception as a form of training to produce future aesthetic memories of off-flavors that can be deployed in a technical context.},

Methods Chemesthetic compounds, responsible for sensations such as burning, cooling, and astringency, are difficult stimuli to work with, especially when the evaluation task requires retasting. Here, we developed a protocol by which chemesthetic compounds can be assessed using sorting. We compared the performance of two cohorts of untrained assessors on this task, one with nose clips and the other without. Similarity matrices were analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) to produce perceptual maps for the two cohorts Overall, the groupings from the nose-open cohort tended to follow a biological basis, consistent with previous findings that suggest compounds that activate a common receptor will elicit similar sensations. The nose-open and nose-pinched cohorts generated significantly different maps. The nose-pinched cohort had a higher variance in the MDS solution than the nose-open group. While the nose-open cohort generated seven clusters, the nose-pinched cohort generated only two clusters, seemingly based on the ready identification of chemesthetic sensations or not. There was less consensus regarding the attributes used to describe the samples in the nose-pinched cohort than in the nose-open cohort as well, as this cohort collectively generated more attributes but fewer were significant in regression. Sorting can be used with orally delivered chemesthetic stimuli in naive assessors, and the resulting perceptual maps differ when nose clips are worn.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a new approach to analyze categorization data called FAST that stands for Factorial Approach for Sorting Task data. This approach, based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), provides an optimal representation of the products, an optimal representation of the consumers, which are to be interpreted jointly. It provides also elements of validation based on confidence ellipses. In the case of ``labelled'' categorization, where a verbalization task is asked to describe the groups of products, it provides an optimal representation of the words which is directly linked to both representations of the products and of the consumers. The FAST approach will be illustrated by an example where 98 consumers were asked to group 12 luxury perfumes.},

  abstract = {The distinctive French wine style "Anjou Village Brissac" was investigated through Quantitative Descriptive Analysis by a sensory expert panel, through just About Right analysis by wine experts. and through assessment of the typicality by wine experts. Typicality was defined as perceived representativeness, with good examples of the concept being considered more typical. Wine experts were producers, winemakers, and enologists from the area. Three types of data were used: (i) quantitative descriptive data on a non-structured scale, (ii) preference data that corresponded to a global typicality index for the wine on a non-structured scale, (iii) data collected on a just About Right non-structured scale, where the middle of the scale, for each attribute, corresponded to Just About Right, an ideal of typicality for wine experts. The two panels, sensorial experts and wine experts, rated 24 Cabernet franc wines from different French "Appellation d'Origine Controlee", including two-thirds "Anjou Village Brissac". Single factor analysis was performed on each panel's data, and results were compared. Multifactor analysis was performed with the data of both panels to highlight the correspondence between the panels. ANOVAs conducted on the differences to the ideal scores permitted the wines to be sorted according to the similarity of their profiles. A penalty analysis was performed to determine, for each attribute, if the rankings on the just About Right scale were related to significantly different results in the preference scores. Therefore, multivariate analysis of just About Right scales served (i) to show an ideal point, (ii) to point out the distance between each product, (iii) and to evaluate the consensus of producers. The results showed the relevance of the sensory expert panels in discriminating the products. The panel of wine experts proved relevant for characterizing the global quality of the wines but did not appear consensual for some attributes. Some attributes from the wine expert panel could be explained by precise descriptors generated by the sensory expert panel. Typicality ratings were considered in relation with descriptive ratings, for example astringency and color attributes. The results presented in this study suggest the usefulness of these sensory techniques for describing wine typicality related to a terroir. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Expert knowledge is a valuable source of information with a wide range of research applications. Despite the recent advances in defining expert knowledge, little attention has been given to how to view expertise as a system of interacting contributory factors for quantifying an individual's expertise. We present a systems approach to expertise that accounts for many contributing factors and their inter-relationships and allows quantification of an individual's expertise. A Bayesian network (BN) was chosen for this purpose. For illustration, we focused on taxonomic expertise. The model structure was developed in consultation with taxonomists. The relative importance of the factors within the network was determined by a second set of taxonomists (supra-experts) who also provided validation of the model structure. Model performance was assessed by applying the model to hypothetical career states of taxonomists designed to incorporate known differences in career states for model testing. The resulting BN model consisted of 18 primary nodes feeding through one to three higher-order nodes before converging on the target node (Taxonomic Expert). There was strong consistency among node weights provided by the supra-experts for some nodes, but not others. The higher-order nodes, ``Quality of work'' and ``Total productivity'', had the greatest weights. Sensitivity analysis indicated that although some factors had stronger influence in the outer nodes of the network, there was relatively equal influence of the factors leading directly into the target node. Despite the differences in the node weights provided by our supra-experts, there was good agreement among assessments of our hypothetical experts that accurately reflected differences we had specified. This systems approach provides a way of assessing the overall level of expertise of individuals, accounting for multiple contributory factors, and their interactions. Our approach is adaptable to other situations where it is desirable to understand components of expertise.},

While there is ample scientific research related to sourdough, there is no standardized approach to using sourdough starters in science or the bread industry; and there are few recommendations on future directions for sourdough research. Our review highlights what is currently known about the microbial ecosystem of sourdough (including microbial succession within the starter culture), methods of maintaining sourdough (analogous to land management) on the path to bread production, and factors that influence the sensory qualities of the final baked product. We present new hypotheses for the successful management of sourdough starters and propose future directions for sourdough research and application to better support and engage the sourdough baking community.},

In the present work, the odor properties of 12 Burgundy Pinot noir wines were described by two independent panels performing, respectively, an intensity-based (conventional descriptive analysis) and a citation frequency-based method. Methods were compared according to three criteria: similarity of the sensory maps, control of panel performance and practical aspects. Intensity scoring and citation frequency data were analyzed, respectively, by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) followed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). Although both methods underlined the same main odor characteristics (fruity, vegetal and oak barrel), dimensionality of CA was higher (four axes) than that of PCA (three axes), probably as a consequence of the larger number of descriptors employed in the frequency-based method. The clustering of wines differed as well between methods. In conventional DA, one sample exhibiting intense barrel aged related notes was responsible for most of the variance of the PCA map. This induced a settling of the rest of the samples and, therefore, a less fine characterization of the emerging clusters than that obtained by CA. Considering both richness of product characterization and practical aspects, the frequency of citation method might represent a convenient alternative to conventional descriptive analysis when the odor assessment of a complex aroma product is required.},

Or, on the contrary, can we show different kinds of olfaction culturally determined or, at least, environmental influences resulting in significant percaptual differences among groups, societies, cultures, etc.? In the first part of the text, I will deal with the invariants (or universals). In the second, I will insist on the cultural types of olfaction. In the third and last part, I will advance the following proposal: beyond the discussion on the roles that nature and culture play in human olfaction, we can sustain that naturally and culturally, there is a way of smelling characteristic of our species. Finally, I will conclude with two examples of the symbolic treatment characteristic of the olfactory human experience.},

Studying the impact of information is particularly relevant for traditional products which communicate about typicality. Extra virgin olive oil is a typical Mediterranean production whose typicality is strongly affected by the origin of its raw material and the manufacturing technology. The present study aims (1) to explore the appropriateness of several sensory descriptors in evaluating the typicality of certain extra virgin olive oils, (2) to assess the impact of information about the origin of the product on the sensory profile perception, (3) to study how the effect of sensory expectations can influence liking and ``typicality'' responses for the experimental oils obtained from a defined cultivar. Working with a panel of consumers familiar with several typical extra virgin olive oils produced in Lucania, a set of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils were evaluated. Results show that there are well defined expectations for some of the sensory properties which characterize the typical olive oils presented. The sensory disconfirmations leading to complete assimilation in sensory perception are associated to higher ``typicality'' ratings. Our results also revealed that bitterness and pungency proved to be the most appropriate sensory descriptors of certain typical olive oils.},

  abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the choice of words for the high and low extreme verbal labels for labeled affective magnitude scales (LAM). In the first study, anchors included greatest imaginable like (or dislike) for ``experiences of any kind'' and for ``a fruit beverage.'' Anchoring the scale to ``any experience'' created a compression effect, restricting the range of the scale that was used. However, both versions of the LAM showed equal discrimination of the acceptance ratings of products in a set of five diverse fruit juice beverages. A second study was conducted to examine the scale positions of various high end anchors, including greatest imaginable like (dislike), greatest imaginable liking for foods, beverages and any experience. Using magnitude estimation, more extreme ratings were found for the liking (or disliking) of ``any experience'' as opposed to simply ``greatest imaginable liking'' (or disliking) and less extreme ratings for anchoring to foods and beverages. The resulting scale values were used to compare three versions of the LAM, with different end anchors and spacings of the interior nine-point hedonic scale labels. As in the first experiment, the range of scores decreased when the end anchor term included ``experiences of any kind'' and also when the spacing of the interior hedonic terms was compressed. However, once again the products were differentiated equally well in acceptance scores by all three versions of the scale. With the product set studied here, there is no apparent advantage to the use of an extreme anchor term referring to ``experiences of any kind'' and use of such an anchor may compress the range of scale values chosen by consumer panelists.},

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate whether this method of free sorting can also be used to investigate the influence of processing parameters. An experimental design was applied to production conditions of enzymatic hydrolysates from salmon by-products. The effect of four processing parameters (time and temperature of hydrolysis, sugar and antioxidant addition) on the odor of the hydrolysates was studied using a sorting task with 45 untrained panelists and a quantitative descriptive analysis carried out with 11 trained panelists. This study on 21 enzymatic hydrolysates confirms the similarity of the two sensory maps and shows the value of free sorting in the sensory characteristic description step, especially to avoid missing some descriptors. It also highlights in this example that a holistic approach as sorting can reveal more easily than profiling the significant effects of process parameters on sensory characteristics and the relationships between sensory dimensions and instrumental measurements of volatile compounds.},

Sixteen samples of Ragusano cheese from two different treatments [pasture and total mixed ration (TMR)] were evaluated after 4 and 7 mo of aging. The color of the cheeses produced from milk of cows consuming fresh native pasture plants was much more yellow than cheeses from TMR fed cows (i.e., higher Hunter b value). This was due to transfer of beta-carotene and related compounds from the diet and demonstrated that compounds from native pasture plants changed the sensory characteristics of Ragusano cheese. To avoid a "halo" effect in a trained panel, quantitative descriptive analysis sensory evaluation of these cheeses for odor, taste, consistency, and mouth structure, color differences among cheeses were masked. A unique approach in sensory analysis was developed using sunglasses with lenses designed to block light at the specific wavelengths at which panelists would detect differences in color among samples. Testing was conducted every 2-wk period (15-d increments) with two tests per week using 11 trained panelists. All the panelists tasted all the products. Panelists were able to detect significant differences in the sensory characteristics of cheeses produced from milk of cows consuming native pastures versus TMR even when the color difference was masked.},

  abstract = {Raw milk from 13 cows fed TMR supplemented with native pasture and from 13 cows fed only TMR on one farm was collected separately 4 times with an interval of 15 d between collections. Two blocks (14 kg each) of cheese were made from each milk. The objective was to determine the influence of consumption of native plants in Sicilian pastures on the aroma compounds present in Ragusano cheese. Milk from cows that consumed native pasture plants produced cheeses with more odor-active compounds. In 4-mo-old cheese made from milk of pasture-fed cows, 27 odor-active compounds were identified, whereas only 13 were detected in cheese made from milk of total mixed ration-fed cows. The pasture cheeses were much more rich in odor-active aldehyde, ester, and terpenoid compounds than cheeses from cows fed only total mixed ration. A total of 8 unique aroma-active compounds (i.e., not reported in other cheeses evaluated by gas chromatography olfactory) were detected in Ragusano cheese made from milk from cows consuming native Sicilian pasture plants. These compounds were 2 aldehydes ([E,E]-2,4-octadienal and dodecanal), 2 esters (geranyl acetate and [E]-methyl jasmonate),1 sulfur compound (methionol), and 3 terpenoid compounds (1-carvone, L(-) carvone, and citronellol). Geranyl acetate and (E)-methyl jasmonate were particularly interesting because these compounds are released from fresh plants as they are being damaged and are part of a possible plant defense mechanism against damage from insects. Most of the odor-active compounds that were unique in Ragusano cheese from pasture-fed cows appeared to be compounds created by oxidation processes in the plants that may have occurred during foraging and ingestion by the cow. Some odor-active compounds were consistently present in pasture cheeses that were not detected in the total mixed ration cheeses or in the 14 species of pasture plants analyzed. Either these compounds were present in other plants not analyzed, created in the rumen or in cheese after the pasture-plant material had been consumed, or the compounds were lost in the method of sample extraction used for the plant analysis (i.e., steam distillation) versus the solid-phase microextraction method used for the cheeses. This research has demonstrated clearly that some unique odor-active compounds found in pasture plants can be transferred to the cheese.},

Local (L) or Commercial (C) saffron was added to cheeses produced by traditional (wood) (L) and plastic (P) tool (tina). At the end, four groups of cheeses were obtained: LL, LC, PL, PC. The experiment was replicated four times. All cheeses samples were analysed at 0 days, 2 and 4 months of ripening. Groups of samples at 0 days of ripening were not discriminated by SMart Nose; this is likely due to the undefined aroma Profile of fresh cheeses, Cheese samples at 2 and 4 months of ripening showed a clearer separation. First data grouping was made considering the tools used during cheese making, as being constant. The instrument enabled the differentiation between the groups LL and LC and the same result was obtained for cheese samples produced using plastic tools (PL and PC). This indicates that the different kind of saffron (Local and Commercial) influences the aroma components of the cheeses. The other data grouping was performed considering the saffron added as constant. LC and PC, LL and PL were analysed and their good separation indicates the important role of the tools on the aroma compounds of the Piacentinu cheese. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

First, temporal check-all-thatapply (TCATA) data are investigated: ten sensory attributes are modelled as vertices and concurrent perception as edges, the size and width of each corresponding to the momentary elicitations and the concurrent elicitations, respectively. A temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) data set does not lend itself as readily to this type of analysis because the task for each assessor involves selection of only one dominant attributes at a time. For this reason, TDS data sets considered in this workshop are (re-)analyzed within localized temporal ranges, considering dominance elicitations within localized temporal ranges to be adjacent-dominant. In TDS by Modality (M-TDS), assessors taste the sample to evaluate the five taste and flavour attributes via TDS, then retaste the sample to evaluate the five texture attributes via TDS. MTDS results from these two separate tasting timelines are adjoined as if they arose from a single evaluation timeline, which ignores systematic biases that may be introduced by the evaluation protocol (e.g. texture attributes are always evaluated with carryover effects from the first tasting). Data from each of these temporal sensory method are then analyzed using a graph theoretic approach. Cliques and attribute structures are identified. TCATA and TDS results are more similar to one another than either is to M-TDS results. Implications of method choice and various data pre-processing decisions are discussed.},

The negative relationship of genetically predisposed sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and food preferences for bitter, creamy, and spicy foods, and alcohol is often reported in both scholarly and popular literature. Our review of research indicates the empirical results are far from conclusive. We conducted a questionnaire-based study to examine enjoyment ratings for 12 foods and beverages often reported to be disliked by PROP supertasters. We measured PROP ratings on the modified gLMS scale and administered a questionnaire to assess food preferences of a sample of 139 college undergraduates. Analysis of variance showed no significant group differences between supertasters, medium tasters, and nontasters in ratings of how much they liked brussels sprouts, raw broccoli, cabbage, spinach, black coffee, dark chocolate, crushed red pepper, jalapenos, chili peppers, red wine, beer, creamy salad dressing, or mayonnaise. Preferences for only two foods out of twelve, dark chocolate and chili peppers, had a significant correlation with PROP sensitivity in the predicted negative direction. While statistically significant, these correlations were low and of little practical significance. The role of culture in shaping attitudes toward food is proposed as a more powerful influence than the genetic factors that relate to PROP sensitivity.},

Additionally, consumers reported their quality expectations of BSB and MWB kulen. An expectancy test revealed higher quality expectations of BSB kulen compared to MWB kulen. The share of respondents preferring BSB kulen in a blind test was significantly lower than that in the expectancy test (negative disconfirmation), while consumers found MWB kulen tasted better than expected (positive disconfirmation). Providing information about the particular pig breed affected preferences positively toward BSB and negatively toward MWB kulen. However, the assimilation of information was complete for MWB, but not for BSB kulen, implying that, apart from extrinsic cues, intrinsic cues have an impact on actual (informed) preferences for kulen sausage.

To accomplish that, in February 2006, the sensory analysis panel of the Department of Food Sciences of the University of Bologna (Italy) carried out systematic sensory analyses of extra virgin olive oils and foods to evaluate the harmony of the pairing. Specific scorecards for olive oil, food and pairing harmony were defined; the resulting harmony was visualized graphically. Some examples of virgin olive oil and food pairing were also presented. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The key finding in this study is its use in the development of a method and relative harmony scorecard for virgin olive oil and food pairing. The results of the study suggest a disharmonic index to evaluate the harmony of pairing.},

We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

  abstract = {Abstract Coffee is one of the most common beverages in the world. However, a sensory lexicon for determining descriptive differences resulting from breeding, agronomic, processing, storage, and brewing modifications is needed. This study developed a sensory lexicon for brewed coffee. More than 100 different coffee samples from 14 countries around the world were used to create this lexicon in four Phases. A highly trained panel assessed all coffee samples using descriptive analysis. The sensory panel identified 110 attributes (many used both for aroma and flavor) and references. Principal component analysis was used to map the scores obtained during the validation phase. For this phase the coffee lexicon allowed the panelists to describe specific characteristics that were present in the coffee samples such as sweet, nutty and fruity notes, as well as the differentiation of notes such as burnt, smoky, astringent, acrid and bitter. The developed attributes and references were successfully used by the trained panel to describe a wide range of coffee samples. The lexicon is considered ``living'' because additional terms should be added as needed to expand the lexicon to include attributes that are not included here. Practical applications The terminology developed during this study is clear, easy to reproduce in future research, and accompanied by reference standards that provide a guide for future studies. This lexicon will provide an important tool for the coffee industry to conduct sensory evaluation to improve the understanding of coffee quality. It is a ``living'' lexicon that can be added to when samples exhibit notes that were not present in the samples used for this lexicon development.}

Wine quality was found to comprise a number of dimensions, both intrinsic to what is drunk and extrinsic to it. These dimensions may be terminal \textendash{} an end state of pleasure \textendash{} or catalytic, factors which help to stimulate resulting pleasure. In theoretical terms the study suggests that quality is a multi-dimensional construct and that consumers engage with it depending on their varying involvement levels with the product. Practically the research offers marketers the chance to understand how quality is conceived by consumers and the varying ways in which drinkers can be grouped based on the quality dimensions they focus on.},

Meanwhile, an individual's food-related personal traits are suspected of playing a moderating role in influencing personal food choice. This study aims to understand what motives determine the consumer's attitude to organic foods in Taiwan, which in turn influence the subsequent purchase intentions. Moderated regression analysis (MRA) is used to ascertain the personality traits of food neophobia and food involvement separately in the behavioral intentions model. The results vindicate the use of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in explaining the consumer's organic foods choice behavior. Moreover, the findings suggest that the food-related personality traits of food neophobia and food involvement exert moderating effects on the relationships between some of the food choice motives and the consumer's attitude to organic foods. However, only food involvement exerts moderating effects on the relationships between the consumer's intentions to purchase organic foods and the antecedents of the TPB except for the subjective norm in this case. Based on the empirical results and findings, some suggestions are provided to the institutions concerned so as to facilitate this organic sector's on-going expansion in Taiwan's food industry.},

Specifically, we model document collections using a class of graphical models called hierarchical latent tree models (HLTMs). The variables at the bottom level of an HLTM are observed binary variables that represent the presence/absence of words in a document. The variables at other levels are binary latent variables that represent word co-occurrence patterns or co-occurrences of such patterns. Each latent variable gives a soft partition of the documents, and document clusters in the partitions are interpreted as topics. Latent variables at high levels of the hierarchy capture long-range word co-occurrence patterns and hence give thematically more general topics, while those at low levels of the hierarchy capture short-range word co-occurrence patterns and give thematically more specific topics. In comparison with LDA-based methods, a key advantage of the new method is that it represents co-occurrence patterns explicitly using model structures. Extensive empirical results show that the new method significantly outperforms the LDA-based methods in term of model quality and meaningfulness of topics and topic hierarchies.},

The dairy products obtained in summer from pasture-based diets presented a more favourable FA profile. Compared with winter, summer milk had lower contents of saturated FA (SFA) (-15.8\%) and higher contents of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) (+33.0\%), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) (+68.2\%), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (+161\%) and vaccenic acid (+148\%). The milk from pasture-based diets presented higher contents of terpenes than did that from winter diets based on hay. Processing milk into ripened cheese had no effect on the FA composition and terpene profile of dairy products. These molecules can confer specific organoleptic and nutritional properties to the dairy products that provide an added value to the product and justify its higher price. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This very efficient method requires a lot of time to train assessors and to teach them how to quantify the sensory characteristics of interest. Over the last few years, other faster and less restricting methods have been developed, such as free choice profile, flash profile, projective mapping or sorting tasks. Among these methods, the sorting task has recently become quite popular in sensory evaluation because of its simplicity: it only requires assessors to make groups of products perceived as similar. Previous studies have shown that this method produces sensory spaces similar to those obtained with conventional profiles but that the descriptions of the products are coarser than the descriptions yielded by sensory profiles. The aim of the present paper is to further evaluate the efficiency of the sorting task as a sensory tool. We present a series of studies highlighting the advantages and delineating the limits of the sorting task and illustrate advantages and limits using beer as the common type of stimuli. These studies underline the main issues encountered when designing sorting tasks. More precisely, we examine the potential of the sorting task to describe beer sensory characteristics, we determine the type of assessors able to perform a sorting task and we evaluate the stability of the results as well as some important methodological points (e.g. number of beers to be sorted, instructions given to the judges) that might impact the efficiency of the task.},

Three dimensions--pleasantness, edibility, cosmetic acceptability--discriminated these groups in the same way in the three countries. In a second experiment, the participants sorted only fruit and flower odors to evaluate whether a consensus emerges at a finer level. Results showed that French and American participants clearly separated fruit from flower odors whereas this separation was nonexistent for Vietnamese participants.

The first group sorted 40 odorants on the basis of odor similarity, the second group sorted 40 odor names on the basis of name similarity and the last group sorted 40 odor names on the basis of imagined odor similarity. Results showed that odor categorization was based on perceptual or conceptual similarity and was in part independent of word and imagined categorizations. In the second experiment, another group of 30 participants from each culture rated the typicality of the odorants for 11 odor categories. Results showed that some odorants were rated as more typical than others. Moreover, the typicality gradient predicted the odor space obtained in the odor sorting task in a consensual way among the three cultures. These results suggest that, as for other categories, odor categories are based on perceptual similarities rather than on semantic cues. Moreover odor-category structure might have a core representation which might be common to different cultures with boundaries which might be more culturally dependent.},

The data were submitted to a series of exploratory factor analyses to 1) reduce the set of variables to a smaller set of summary scales and 2) get a preliminary sense of the differentiation of affective feelings elicited by odors. The goal of Study 2 was to replicate the findings of Study 1 with a larger sample of odorant samples and participants and to validate the preliminary model obtained in Study 1 by using confirmatory factor analysis. Overall, the findings point to a structure of affective responses to odors that differs from the classical taxonomies of emotion such as posited by discrete or bidimensional emotion theories. These findings suggest that the subjective affective experiences or feelings induced by odors are structured around a small group of dimensions that reflect the role of olfaction in well-being, social interaction, danger prevention, arousal or relaxation sensations, and conscious recollection of emotional memories.},

Four types of Korean and 4 types of Japanese style fermented soybean consisting of whole bean type and paste type were analyzed. Ten Korean and 9 Japanese panelists were recruited in Korea. Two separate descriptive analyses were conducted, with the panelists differing in their country of origin. Each group was trained, developed lexicon, and conducted descriptive analysis independently. Analysis of variance and various multivariate analyses were applied to delineate the sensory characteristics of the samples and to compare the cross-cultural differences in the usage of lexicon. The Korean and Japanese panelists generated 48 and 36 sensory attributes, respectively. Cross-cultural consensus was shown for evaluating the whole bean type fermented soybean and white miso, which were relatively distinctive samples. However, for the less distinctive samples, the panelists tend to rate higher in negative attributes for the fermented soybeans that originated from the other country. The Japanese panelists grouped the samples by their country of origin and soy sauce flavor was the main attribute for cross-cultural differentiation. However, the Korean panelists did not make a cross-cultural distinction among the samples.},

The milk was processed as Caciotta cheese and ripened for 20 days. The VOC analyses (by GC-MS) showed the highest VOC total content in AS cheeses (226.55a.u.), where alcohols was the dominant class; the lowest value (79.96a.u.) was found in TI cheeses, and the dominant class was hydrocarbons. The panel test (for colour, odour, taste and final acceptability) showed that cheeses from grasses' groups were described with astringent and blue taste, those from legumes with acidic, bitter and light goaty taste. All cheeses showed goaty taste, except LP cheeses. Grasses' cheeses showed higher final acceptability than those from legumes. The results showed that each meadow's species, with its specific content of secondary metabolites, at specific phenological stage, was able to characterise the derived cheese products at sensorial level.},

  abstract = {The decision-making process involved in food selection and consumption behaviors is confounded by mental integration of information, experiences, and emotions associated with the product (stimulus). The complex and fleeting but temporal nature of product-generated (PG) or product-associated (PA) emotions makes affectual experiences difficult to measure and interpret. This project aims to characterize the relationship between PA, and PG, emotions and consumer acceptability and purchase intent towards milk packaging. Participants (age: 18\textendash 65 years; n = 50; milk consumers) performed Single Target Implicit Association Tests (ST-IAT) to capture PA emotions for various types of milk packaging (n=6; translucent high density polyethylene (HDPE), white HDPE, yellow HDPE, white polyethyleneteraphthalate (PET), paperboard, glass). Participants then interacted with individual packages for 30 seconds and their facial expressions were analyzed using automated facial expression analysis (AFEA) for implicit PG emotions. Explicit PG emotional response was assessed using a Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) questionnaire (43 emotional terms). ST-IAT did not identify significant PA emotions for packaged milk, but CATA data produced a reasonable description of approach/withdrawal motivation related to packaging pigmentation. Time series analysis of AFEA data provided evidence of significant differences in emotion intensity. The lack of difference between certain expressed emotions (e.g., happy and disgust) that maintain no related action units (AUs) indicate that AFEA software's output may not be identifying AUs and determining emotion-based inferences in agreement with FACS. Ultimately, both PA and PG emotions are valuable for informing packaging, food, and dairy industries towards consumer products via their packaging.},

  abstract = {To characterize human emotions, researchers have increasingly utilized Automatic Facial Expression Analysis (AFEA), which automates the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and translates the facial muscular positioning into the basic universal emotions. There is broad interest in the application of FACS for assessing consumer expressions as an indication of emotions to consumer product-stimuli. However, the translation of FACS to characterization of emotions is elusive in the literature. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of how FACS has been used to investigate human emotional behavior to consumer product-based stimuli. The search was limited to studies published in English after 1978, conducted on humans, using FACS or its action units to investigate affect, where emotional response is elicited by consumer product-based stimuli evoking at least one of the five senses. The search resulted in an initial total of 1,935 records, of which 55 studies were extracted and categorized based on the outcomes of interest including (i) method of FACS implementation; (ii) purpose of study; (iii) consumer product-based stimuli used; and (iv) measures of affect validation. Most studies implemented FACS manually (73\%) to develop products and/or software (20\%) and used consumer product-based stimuli that had known and/or defined capacity to evoke a particular affective response, such as films and/or movie clips (20\%); minimal attention was paid to consumer products with low levels of emotional competence or with unknown affective impact. The vast majority of studies (53\%) did not validate FACS-determined affect and, of the validation measures that were used, most tended to be discontinuous in nature and only captured affect as it holistically related to an experience. This review illuminated some inconsistencies in how FACS is carried out as well as how emotional response is inferred from facial muscle activation. This may prompt researchers to consider measuring the total consumer experience by employing a variety of methodologies in addition to FACS and its emotion-based interpretation guide. Such strategies may better conceptualize consumers' experience with products of low, unknown, and/or undefined capacity to evoke an affective response such as product prototypes, line extensions, etc.},

This article suggests that an ordinal statistic, d, is often more appropriate. d compares the number of times a score from one group or condition is higher than one from the other, compared with the reverse. Compared to mean comparisons, d is more robust and equally or more powerful; it is invariant under transformation; and it often conforms more closely to the experimeter's research hypothesis. It is suggested that inferences from d be based on sample estimates of its variance rather than on the more traditional assumption of identical distributions. The statistic is extended to simple repeated measures designs, and ways of extending its use to more complex designs are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Experiment 1 demonstrated hedonic contrast in both directions by using 2 sets of stimuli presented in different orders. Preceding moderately unattractive faces with moderately attractive faces made the unattractive faces more unattractive. When the order of presentation was reversed, the moderately attractive faces became more attractive. Experiment 2 found that this hedonic contrast was eliminated when the moderately attractive faces were replaced with extremely attractive faces. Experiment 3 showed that even with those 2 sets of extremely different stimuli, hedonic contrast occurred if subjects were instructed to think of both sets of stimuli as belonging to the same category. These findings, using hedonic judgments, parallel Sarris's (1967, 1968) finding with weights that when 2 sets of stimuli are too different in the dimension being judged, no contrast occurs. They also lend support to his explanation for this result. When the 2 sets of stimuli are too different they are not seen as belonging to the same category. They are therefore not compared, and contrast does not occur. The authors propose that these principles might apply to contrast in all settings.},

  abstract = {Equilibration of a \textasciimacron avour volatile between a distilled spirit and the headspace is a two-stage process. The \textregistered rst equilibrium occurs between the bulk solution and the headspace spirit interface, and the second between the surface layer and the headspace. The \textregistered rst stage is represented by the activity coef\textregistered cient of the \textasciimacron avour volatile, which, for hydrophobic compounds, is greatly reduced by the aggregation of ethanol molecules in aqueous solution. The second equilibrium is governed by the vapour pressure of the solute and the ambient temperature and pressure. In mixed saturated solutions the composition of the surface layer and consequently the headspace is determined by the concentration and activity coef\textregistered cients of the mixture components. Components of wood extract were found to act principally on the \textregistered rst equilibrium. Ethanol lignin acted in the same manner as high molecular weight esters and alcohols of the distillate, displacing volatile components from the surface layer. The suppressant effect of ethanol lignin was lost at 37 \textdegree C and consequently would only be important in nosing of spirit samples. Wood extract was found to decrease the critical point for the aggregation of ethanol, resulting in reduced activity coef\textregistered cients for ethyl decanoate from 5 to 30\% ethanol at both 25 and 37 \textdegree C. This effect would reduce the spirit{$\pm$}mouthspace partition coef\textregistered cient with the resulting decreased release of \textasciimacron avour volatile in the mouth. This mechanism would explain the decreased impact of undesirable, immature aromas when wood matured spirits are consumed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the kinds of evaluation measures used in 265 nutrition education intervention studies conducted between 1980 and 1999 and an analysis of psychometric issues arising from such a review. The data are summarized in terms of tables for interventions with each of six key population groups: preschool children, school-aged children, adults, pregnant women and breastfeeding promotion, older adults, and inservice preparation of professionals and paraprofessionals. Measures evaluating knowledge and skills or behavioral capabilities were most widely used in studies with preschool, school-aged, and inservice populations (50\%\textendash 85\%) and less widely used in studies with the other groups, particularly breast-feeding promotion (5\%). Measures of potential psychosocial mediators or correlates of behavior such as outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, or behavioral intention were used in 90\% of behaviorally focused studies with school-aged children and in about 20\% of studies with adults. Dietary intake measures were used in almost all studies, primarily food recalls, records, and quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Short frequency instruments involving only foods targeted in the intervention such as fruits and vegetables are increasingly being used. Measures of specific observable behaviors are also increasingly being used. Physiologic parameters were used in about 33\% of behaviorally focused interventions with school-aged children and adults, 20\% with older adults, and 65\% with pregnant women and/or their infants. Criterion validity of newly developed intake instruments and content validity of instruments measuring mediating variables were reported in the majority (range 50\%\textendash 90\%) of studies. Reliability and stability of measures of mediating variables were reported in 50\% to 75\% of studies, with reliability coefficients mostly about .6 to .7. Two major conclusions from this review are that evaluation measures should be appropriate to the purpose, duration, and power of the intervention and that measures should have adequate validity and reliability in relation to both the outcomes and characteristics of the target audience. Major implications are that considerable preliminary work needs to be done before any intervention study to develop and test evaluation instruments so that they are appropriate and have adequate psychometric properties, and cognitive testing of published instruments with each new target audience is essential. We will then be better able to make judgments about the effectiveness of nutrition education.},

Drawing on research on the social and cultural dimensions of eating, we contrast this approach with what we call ``Epicurean'' eating pleasure, which is the enduring pleasure derived from the aesthetic appreciation of the sensory and symbolic value of the food. To contrast both approaches, we develop and test a scale measuring Epicurean eating pleasure tendencies and show that they are distinct from the tendency to experience visceral pleasure (measured using the external eating and emotional eating scales). We find that Epicurean eating pleasure is more prevalent among women than men but is independent of age, income and education. Unlike visceral eating pleasure tendencies, Epicurean eating tendencies are associated with a preference for smaller food portions and higher wellbeing, and not associated with higher BMI. Overall, we argue that the moralizing approach equating the pleasure of eating with `low-level' visceral urges should give way to a more holistic approach which recognizes the positive role of Epicurean eating pleasure in healthy eating and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {Terpene profiles in cheese can be considered a `terroir' fingerprint as the information contained in it should enable the pastures on which the animals were fed to be recognised. Yet a certain elasticity of the signature must be taken into account when determining authentication strategies, since products acknowledged as containing a common signature may have undergone certain procedures, such as cheese making and milk pasteurisation, that could have potentially altered their terpene profiles. In this study, Cantal and Saint-Nectaire-type cheeses were made from both raw and pasteurised milk from the same herd of dairy cows that had been grazed on natural grassland. Cheeses from raw and pasteurised milk were made from the same milking on the same days. Cantal and Saint-Nectaire-type cheeses were made on 4 different days, alternatively over four weeks. The terpenes in the cheese fat were analysed by dynamic headspace/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A great diversity of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and oxygen-containing derivatives were identified. The major terpenes identified in most cheeses were {$\beta$}-caryophyllene, {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-pinene and limonene. Milk pasteurisation did not induce changes in the terpene profile of the cheese. Significant differences (p {$<$} 0.001) were observed between Cantal and Saint-Nectaire cheeses: {$\alpha$}-pinene, {$\beta$}-myrcene and {$\beta$}-phellandrene were, respectively, three, five and five times more abundant in Cantal cheese, while tricyclene, {$\alpha$}-phellandrene and geraniol were found exclusively in Cantal cheese. In contrast, unidentified sesquiterpenes with retention indices (KI) = 1342 and 1511, {$\alpha$}-cubebene, longifolene and {$\gamma$} -elemene were more abundant or exclusively found in Saint-Nectaire cheese. A significant relationship with the date of milking (p {$<$} 0.01) was observed for {$\alpha$}-pinene and tricyclene in Cantal, for {$\beta$}-myrcene, {$\delta$}-3-carene, p-cymene and {$\alpha$}-terpinene in Saint-Nectaire cheese.},

The study was conducted in a commercial vineyard consisting of the same clone, rootstock, age, and vineyard management practices. In 2003, vine vigor parameters were used to designate vigor zones within two vineyard sites to produce research wines. Similar winemaking practices were used. Descriptive sensory analysis and partial least squares (PLS) modeling was done on two-year-old wines. Wines and model extracts were analyzed by HPLC. Significant sensory attributes included earthy, chemical, heat, sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent. Astringency was the most important attribute used to differentiate the wines. Low vigor wines had much higher astringency than high vigor wines. Positively correlated variables included number of seeds per berry, fruit total tannin (mg/kg), and skin tannin (mg/kg), while total f lavan-3-ol monomers per seed, total f lavan-3-ol monomers per berry, fruit TA, and berry weight were negatively correlated with the sensory attributes. Interestingly, seed tannin was not an important variable in the model. There was a strong relationship between fruit total tannin and wine astringency, which was related to differences in skin rather than seed-derived tannin. There was a strong relationship between measured and predicted astringency.},

In this procedure, subjects form as many groups of stimuli as they consider necessary, with the understanding that each group is formed with stimuli that are perceived as similar. However, no information is available about the structure of the groups formed by each subject. In practice, these groups are considered as equally distant from each other. This is a questionable assumption as it may not reflect the perception of the subjects towards the stimuli. Taxonomic free sorting is designed to cope with this problem. Once the subjects have achieved the free sorting of the stimuli, they are instructed to organize, step by step, the stimuli into a hierarchical structure thus giving more insight into the similarities among products. Statistical treatments of the data thus obtained are discussed and the procedure of evaluation is illustrated on the basis of a case study.},

The index takes a value on the interval between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates more similar partitions. Sometimes, e.g. when the units are observed in two time periods, the splitting and merging of clusters should be considered differently, according to the operationalization of the stability of clusters. The Rand Index is symmetric in the sense that both the splitting and merging of clusters lower the value of the index. In such a non-symmetric case, one of the Wallace indexes (Wallace, 1983) can be used. Further, there are several cases when one wants to compare two partitions obtained on different sets of units, where the intersection of these sets of units is a non-empty set of units. In this instance, the new units and units which leave the clusters from the first partition can be considered as a factor lowering the value of the index. Therefore, a modified Rand index is presented. Because the splitting and merging of clusters have to be considered differently in some situations, an asymmetric modified Wallace Index is also proposed. For all presented indices, the correction for chance is described, which allows different values of a selected index to be compared.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified Odor Profile Method (OPM) at a trash transfer station (TTS). An updated Landfill Odor Wheel was used to define odor character and distinguish among odor sources. The Flavor Profile Analysis (FPA) intensity scale was used to rank the relative intensity of the various odor characters defined by the odor wheel and to understand how each odor profile changed off site. Finally, the odor wheel was used to select the appropriate chemical analysis to identify the odorants causing the odors identified by the human panelists. The OPM was demonstrated as an effective tool for characterizing and distinguishing odor sources at a TTS. Municipal solid waste (MSW) odors were characterized as rancid, sulfur, and fragrant; rancid odors were dominant in the odor profile on-site, while sulfur odors dominated off-site. Targeted chemical analysis was used to identify odorants potentially responsible for odors at the site. Methyl mercaptan (rotten vegetable) and hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg) were identified as the odorants most likely to be responsible for the sulfur odors at the site.

Terpenes/pine odors were observed near the greenwaste pile.

  abstract = {One would believe that with the increasing importance attached to consumers in contemporary affluent societies, the difficulty to understand today's `butterfly' or `unmanageable' consumers seems to double simultaneously. Modern consumers defy traditional segmentation by age, gender or income. Classical criteria to distinguish different homogeneous groups of consumers with corresponding behavioral intentions and patterns, have lost much of their explanatory power. Hence, the behaviour of the inhabitants of modern consumer society can no longer be understood by `straight' and measurable segmentation criteria only. In order to meet the complexities of modern consumer behaviour, it is suggested that we need to improve our understanding of socio-cultural and socio-psychological influences on consumer choices. Such are awarded to be supplementary to socio-demographic (e.g. age, gender) or socio-economic (e.g. income, occupation) criteria, which are traditionally used in consumer studies. Our contribution to this quest for new perspectives, in which consumption is both seen as an economic/materialistic and a socio-cultural/attitudinal phenomenon, is called the consumer images approach. The underpinnings of this approach are the dimensions materialism/nonmaterialism and individualism/collectivism. Based on these two dimensions, four consumer images are distinguished in a four-quadrantic continuum. This implies that consumer images are not another set of taxonomies to `box in' consumers. The consumer images approach is in tune with lines of thought in the recent renaissance of the sociology of consumption. To illustrate this, a presentation of the multifaceted consumer will be given that is interlarded with quotations from several new studies on contemporary consumerism which give evidence of the current vitality of scholarly interest in consumption.},

Design: Two researchers conducted 14 audiotaped, 60-minute focus groups. Height and weight were measured. Setting: Libraries, homeless shelters, and a community center. Participants: Ninety-two low-income children aged 9-13 years. Phenomenon of Interest: How environmental, personal, and behavioral factors affect food choices and food-related behavior at home, in school, and at restaurants, and how these factors potentially influence weight status. Analysis: Transcripts were coded, reconciled, and analyzed for themes and subthemes. Results: At home, children's food choices were often unhealthful because of the types of food available, and some reported restricted eating styles and night eating. At school, children were largely dissatisfied with the quality of lunches provided, and some skipped the meal. Most children preferred buffets as their favorite type of restaurant, where they could eat unlimited quantities of their favorite food items. Over half of the children were overweight (19\%) or obese (36\%). Conclusions and Implications: Future research may examine the prevalence of night eating, meal skipping, and other irregular eating behaviors among low-income children and their long-term relationship to weight status. Increasing parents' knowledge of these behaviors, while emphasizing the importance of family mealtimes, is encouraged.},

  abstract = {Background: Food choices are influenced by an individual's attitude towards foods. Food neophobia may be associated with less variety of diets, inadequate nutrient intake and high product failure rate for new food products entering the market. To quantify the extent of these challenges, instruments to measure the food neophobia in different target groups are needed. Several such instruments with significantly different measurement outcomes and procedures have been developed. This review provides an overview and discusses strengths and weaknesses of these instruments. Objective: We evaluate strengths and weaknesses of previously developed instruments to measure neophobia and willingness to try unfamiliar foods. Design: Literature was searched through the databases Web of Science and Google Scholar. We identified 255 studies concerning neophobia and willingness to try unfamiliar foods. Of these, 13 studies encompassing 13 instruments to measure neophobia and willingness to try unfamiliar foods were included in the review. Results are summarized and evaluated with a narrative approach. Results: In the 13 instruments to assess neophobia and willingness to try unfamiliar foods, 113 to 16.644 subjects aged 2e65 years were involved, scales with 3e7 response categories were used and behavioral validation tests were included in 6 studies. Conclusions: Several instruments to measure neophobia and willingness to try unfamiliar foods exist. We recommend selecting one or more among the 13 instruments reviewed in this paper to assess relevant aspects of neophobia.},

However, despite the public health importance, most countries have not mandated the labeling of added sugar content on packaged foods and beverages, making it difficult for consumers to avoid products with added sugar, and limiting the ability of policymakers to identify priority products for intervention.To develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of added sugar content in packaged products using available nutrient, ingredient, and food category information.The added sugar prediction algorithm was developed using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and packaged food information from the US Label Insight dataset (n~=~70,522). A synthetic dataset of Australian packaged products (n~=~500) was used to assess validity and generalization. Performance metrics included the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and Spearman rank correlation ({$\rho$}). To benchmark the KNN approach, the KNN approach was compared to an existing added sugar prediction approach that relies on a series of manual steps.Compared to the existing added sugar prediction approach, the KNN approach was similarly apt at explaining variation in added sugar content (R2~=~0.96~vs. 0.97 respectively) and ranking products from highest to lowest in added sugar content ({$\rho$} = 0.91~vs. 0.93 respectively), while less apt at minimizing absolute deviations between predicted and true values (MAE~=~1.68~g vs. 1.26~g per 100~g or 100~mL respectively).KNN can be used to predict added sugar content in packaged products with a high degree of validity. Being automated, KNN can easily be applied to large datasets. Such predicted added sugar levels can be used to monitor the food supply and inform interventions aimed at reducing added sugar intake.},

Food choices varied along temporal and value dimensions, and along the process-oriented stages of food choice identified by Marjorie DeVault, namely provisioning, processing and feeding. Eating was added to DeVault's stages to capture the importance participants placed on the health consequences of consumption, and to describe how tradition was employed to enable and rationalize food choices across these stages and dimensions.We also identify how coping with new pressures from the food environment was gendered work, specifically the work of women.},

At present, educational TV cooking shows focus on the transfer of cooking knowledge and skills, whereas edutainment TV cooking shows focus on entertaining their viewers. Both types of shows are ongoing success stories. However, little is known regarding the shows' links with the cooking and eating habits of their audiences. Therefore, the current study investigates the relationship between watching an educational or edutainment TV cooking show and one's cooking and eating habits. Given public health concerns regarding the decline in cooking behaviors and the simultaneous increase in caloric intake from food outside the home, this study suggests a promising intervention. The results of a cross-sectional survey in Belgium (n~=~845) demonstrate that the audiences of educational and edutainment TV cooking shows do not overlap. Although there is little connection between watching specific shows and eating behavior, the connection between watching shows and cooking behaviors varies across gender and age lines. Behaviors also differ depending on whether the viewer is watching an educational or edutainment cooking show. For example, men of all ages appear to cook more often if they watch an educational show. However, only older men (above 38 years) seem to cook more often if they watch an edutainment TV show. The results demonstrate that the relationship between watching TV cooking shows and cooking habits warrants further investigation.},

Focusing on mediators of the relationship between broad universalistic values and meat choices, we examined how involvement in food can be separated into promotion-oriented and prevention-oriented motivational goals. In a survey among 1530 Dutch consumers we found that most of the basic human values were to a certain extent related to the direction of the food choice motives. However, giving priority to universalism appeared to be unique in its impact on food choices favouring less meat or free-range meat. This impact was weak but robust and it was mediated by prevention-oriented food choice motives together with a high level of involvement in food and motive-congruent animal friendly attitudes.},

The aim of this study was to consider parameters which contribute to beer differentiation according to the quality grade. Chemical (e.g. pH, acidity, dry extract, alcohol content, CO2 content) and sensory features (e.g. bitter taste, color) were determined in 70 beer samples and used as variables in decision tree techniques. This pattern recognition techniques applied to the dataset were able to extract information useful in obtaining a satisfactory classification of beer samples according to their quality grade.

For measurement of real-world intake, the diet-diary technique is imperfect and tends to underestimate actual intakes but it appears to be sensitive, can detect subtle influences on eating behavior, and produces reliable and valid measures. Research studies in the real world show the multivariate richness of the natural environment, which allows investigation of the complexities of intake regulation, and even causation can be investigated. Real-world research can overcome some of the weaknesses of laboratory studies, where constraints on eating are often removed or missing, facilitatory influences on eating are often controlled or eliminated, the importance of variables can be overestimated, and important influences can be missed because of the short durations of the studies. Real-world studies have shown a wide array of physiologic, psychological, and social variables that can have potent and immediate effects on intake. Compensatory mechanisms, including some that operate with a 2- to 3-d delay, adjust for prior excesses. Heredity affects all aspect of food-intake regulation, from the determination of body size to the subtleties of the individual preferences and social proclivities and the extent to which environmental factors affect the individual. Hence, real-world research teaches valuable lessons, and much more is needed to complement laboratory studies.},

  abstract = {The interest in children's eating behaviours and how to change them has been growing in recent years. This review examines the following questions: What strategies have been used to change children's eating behaviours? Have their effects been experimentally demonstrated? And, are the effects transient or enduring? Medline and Cab abstract (Ovid) and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) were used to identify the experimental studies. A total of 120 experimental studies were identified and they are presented grouped within these 11 topics; parental control, reward, social facilitation, cooking programs, school gardens, sensory education, availability and accessibility, choice architecture and nudging, branding and food packaging, preparation and serving style, and offering a choice. In conclusion, controlling strategies for changing children's eating behaviour in a positive direction appear to be counterproductive. Hands-on approaches such as gardening and cooking programs may encourage greater vegetable consumption and may have a larger effect compared to nutrition education. Providing children with free, accessible fruits and vegetables have been experimentally shown to positively affect long-term eating behaviour. The authors recommend future research to examine how taste and palatability can positively affect children's attitudes and eating behaviour.},

Liking ratings on the nine-point hedonic scale were obtained in an US Army field study and for the same foods in a sensory laboratory. In a subsequent choice simulation laboratory with two food groupings, we offered subjects some choice (three out of six or seven items) among to which foods they would evaluate. The results showed high correlations between lab and field ratings for the snack food groupings (0.58\textendash 0.94), but low correlations for the main dishes (K0.05\textendash 0.26) and meal components (K0.07\textendash 0.41). Correlations between mean field and mean laboratory data improved when laboratory subjects were offered a choice of foods. The ability of laboratory ratings to predict acceptability of foods consumed under realistic conditions appears to depend on the type of food, and may be better for foods used as snacks than for main dishes. Laboratory conditions in which subjects had some degree of choice among foods improved the relationship with the field data. It is important to pay more attention to experimental variables that may improve the validity of sensory laboratory tests.},

  abstract = {Two new rapid descriptive sensory evaluation methods are introduced to the field of food sensory evaluation. The first method, free multiple sorting, allows subjects to perform ad libitum free sortings, until they feel that no more relevant dissimilarities among products remain. The second method is a modal restriction of Napping to specific sensory modalities, directing sensation and still allowing a holistic approach to products. The new methods are compared to Flash Profiling, Napping and conventional descriptive sensory profiling. Evaluations are performed by several panels of expert assessors originating from two distinct research environments. Evaluations are performed on the same nine p\^at\'e products and within the same period of time. Results are analysed configurationally (graphically) as well as with RV coefficients, semantically and practically. Parametric bootstrapped confidence ellipses are applied for the graphical validation and comparisons. This allows similar comparisons and is applicable to single-block evaluation designs such as Napping. The partial Napping allows repetitions on multiple sensory modalities, e.g. appearance, taste and mouthfeel, and shows the average of these repetitions to be significantly more closely related to the conventional profile than other methods. Semantic comparison shows large differences, with closest relations found between the two conventional profiles. This suggests that semantic results from an assessor in an evaluation type with no training sessions are dependent on the assessors' personal semantic skills. Comparisons of the methods' practical differences highlight the time advantage of the rapid approaches and their individual differences in the number of attributes generated.},

The main hypothesis of this theory is quite straightforward: the more characteristic aroma compounds that two foods have in common, the better they taste together. The hypothesis is based on the fact that 80 percent of food's flavor is determined by how our nose picks up volatile aromatic compounds. Although the elegance and simplicity of Food Pairing Theory makes it convincing, in this article it is shown that it is as scientifically unsound as it is popular with the practitioners of European haute cuisine. Moreover, it is argued that because of the impracticality of the Food Pairing Theory and the availability of easier food pairing alternatives, it is likely that this theory will not stand the test of time to become a part of cooks' repertoires. It is a food fad that will likely disappear and soon make place for a new one.}

The aim of this technique is to determine the odour activity of volatile compounds in a sample extract, and assign a relative importance to each compound. Methods can be classified into three types: detection frequency, dilution to threshold and direct intensity. Dilution to threshold methods measure the potency of odour-active compounds by using a series of extract dilutions, whereas detection frequency and direct-intensity methods measure odour-active compound intensity, or relative importance, in a single concentrated extract. Factors that should be considered to improve the value of GC-O analysis are the extraction method, GC instrument conditions, including the design and operation of the odour port, methods of recording GC-O data and controlling the potential for human assessor bias using experimental design and a trained panel. Considerable emphasis is placed on the requirement for multidimensional GC analysis, and on best practice when using human assessors.},

Simultaneously, the ?in-store? acceptability of these cultivars was evaluated by 120 consumers from northern California. The relationships among instrumental measurements (flesh firmness, ripe soluble solids concentration (RSSC), and ripe titratable acidity (RTA), sensory panel descriptors, and consumer hedonic responses were studied. In these cultivars, RSSC was the only instrumental measurement significantly related to overall liking. Cultivars with medium acidity and/or flavor/aroma were liked ?very much,? and consumer willingness to pay more was correlated with overall liking without regard to cultivar. Cluster analysis revealed 3 segments that were associated with ethnicity and consumer preferences within each segment. Sweetness was the main driver of liking for 2 consumer clusters; however, for the 3rd cluster, the perception of fruit aromas described as grassy/green fruit and pit aromas were the main drivers of liking. There was a high correlation between instrumental measurements and their sensory perception; however, the sensory attribute measurements explained cultivar characteristics better than instrumental measurements alone. Sweetness correlated positively with overall liking and consumer acceptance.},

First, we use dedicated, amenable software aimed at producing term lemmatization and construction of contingency table, enabling minimum manual verification and correction. Furthermore, co-occurrences are treated as a textual weighted network, which can be further iterated and renormalized in a flexible way, filtering out rare terms and their associations. In addition, visualization and clustering techniques, initially developed in social networks studies, reveal meaningful and well-defined terms communities, corresponding to distinct conceptions of minerality. Results are exclusively based upon statistical methods, without resorting to semantic nor linguistic considerations. Altogether, they demonstrate the polysemy and ill-definiteness of the concept of minerality among wine professionals.},

Employment in the Parmigiano Reggiano production system is twice as high as in the industrial dairy system and the pressure of the system on the environment is significantly lower.

The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics\textemdash politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case\textemdash the politics surrounding foie gras in France\textemdash demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization.},

  abstract = {In the 1960s, food scientists turned their attention to the problem of texture, asking how it could be defined as a discrete sensory property of food, measured with instruments, and made useful for industrial manufacturers. In the ensuing decade researchers in North America, Japan, and elsewhere proposed answers to these questions in specialized trade journals, where they crafted sophisticated mathematics, described measuring apparatuses and protocols, and shared the results of social surveys that pointed to the deep cultural relevance of their work. The result of their efforts was an articulation of eating as a physiological practice that lay below the surface of human consciousness, one that could be engaged by informed food manufacturers seeking to increase their share of the retail market. By literally restructuring the physical sensations of nutrition and domestic economy, this knowledge of texture was positioned to assist corporate food manufacturers in expanding their role in the lives of ordinary consumers.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sensory profiles of 13 coffee samples from the Huila Region, Colombia were evaluated using two different sensory panels: a highly trained descriptive sensory panel and a group of Q-certified coffee cuppers. The trained panel consisted of six descriptive panelists who developed a lexicon to evaluate and then test the coffee samples. Four ?cuppers? scored the same samples based on the Specialty Coffee Association of America ?cupping protocol.? In addition, cuppers generated tasting notes to characterize the different coffee samples. Data indicated little overlap between the two methods and a low relationship between the two different sets of terms. Moreover, tasting notes by cuppers indicate lack of agreement on the terms used to describe samples, with only four terms used by more than two assessors to describe a single coffee product out of a total of 59 terms used by the cuppers. The results indicate that the cupping method and sensory descriptive methods provide different information that cannot be used as an alternative to each other when describing coffee products. Instead, the results suggest that the two types of data may be used synergistically to evaluate the quality and the sensory properties to better characterize coffee samples. Practical Applications This research shows that ?expert? coffee cupper data and trained sensory panel data cannot be used interchangeably. Thus, for research purposes sensory panel information is necessary for tracking changes in sensory properties.},

  abstract = {Service Quality (SQ) in Public Transport (PT) has been a crucial aspect to improve for years because of its strong influence on user satisfaction and its capacity to attract new passengers. Different techniques have been applied for analysing SQ and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is one of the most widely used due to its ability to address different kinds of variables and to model a whole phenomenon occurring at one time. Nevertheless, its confirmative nature requires previous knowledge, a hurdle that can be overcome by applying Bayesian Networks (BN) as a technique that learns directly from data without pre-assumptions. The aim of this paper is to apply a novel methodological approach in the field of SQ, based on a two-step process, which combines the techniques of BN and SEM, to model SQ in the Metropolitan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Service of Seville (Spain). In other words, in this paper, the proposed methodological approach has been applied to extract and confirm, directly from data and without necessity of assumptions, the possible relationships among the LRT service characteristics and how they are related with passengers' overall SQ perception. For this purpose, firstly, a BN was automatically learnt from the data and allowed to establish relationships between SQ dimensions describing the service. SEM was then used to check the SQ model and the relationships between the dimensions extracted from the BN. The model fit parameters of SEM and its consistency with the real life expected scenario supported and validated the SQ model designed in this study. Furthermore, the different relationships among dimensions extracted from BN were analysed and support the usefulness and potential of this methodological process that could lead to the development and confirmation of new theories and models in any field of knowledge based on data and expert supervision.},

This study critically analysed the content of one weekly nutrition column written by a nutritional expert in a popular New Zealand magazine, from a social constructionist perspective, to investigate how nutritional advice constructs food, food practices and eaters. The analysis identified a range of ways in which the nutrition information communicated in the articles was potentially problematic for readers. The articles advocated eating for health with recommendations based on nutritional science, but depicted nutritional information as inconclusive, changeable and open to interpretation. Fear-based messages were used to motivate making 'healthy' food choices, through linking 'unhealthy' food choices with fatness and chronic ill health. Unhealthy foods were portrayed as more enjoyable than healthy foods, social occasions involving food were constructed as problematic, and exercise was defined only as a way to negate food consumption. Healthy eating was portrayed as a matter of personal choice, obscuring the situational factors that impact on food choice and health. We conclude that the nutritional advice analysed in this study constructs a way of understanding food that, if internalised by eaters, may evoke anxiety, confusion and dissatisfaction around food and eating.},

Brew. 114(4), 329\textendash 342, 2008 The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the sensory characteristics of beer and food that harmonically complement each other respectively from the consumer or the sommelier point of view. With this in view, the most desirable beer and everyday Italian food combinations were explored. Eighteen beer samples, easily available in the off-premise chain in Italy, and 9 dishes of Italian cuisine, were selected. The level of match of each beer and food combination was determined by a group of 51 consumers and by seven food experts using a 9point Likert-like scale of suitability. Agreements and disagreements between food professionals and consumers were studied and discussed. Generally speaking, most of the dishes were poor complements to the beers selected for this study, for both regular consumers and experts. In particular, seafood salad, spaghetti with tomato sauce and creamed vegetable soup were inappropriate to nearly all of the beer samples overall. However, both consumers and experts found appropriate and interesting beer and food pairing choices, despite usually indicating different ideal beer samples and different levels of match for the same food. This confirmed that certain flavours of food and beer mix together better than others and indicates that consumers may have a different perception of the level of match between beer and food from experts. For regular consumers, the suitability to food was found to positively correlate with the sensory liking of beer. Furthermore the pairing suitability was not equivalent across consumer gender and age class, although these differences had a moderate to weak effect on the level of the final match. Correlations between sensory properties of food and beer samples are reported and discussed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The sensory profiles of 72 beers commercially available in Italy were described and quantified using descriptive analysis procedures. Principal component analysis indicated that nearly 74\% of the variance across samples can be described by the first six principal components. Raw materials and specifically grains impart flavors that are responsible for the main source of variations and discrimination among beers of the Italian market. Second direction of variation is summarized by the perceived overall structure of a given brand and its fruity ester flavors. Although sameness seems to be the key word for pale lagers of the market as emerges from the application of multivariate techniques, this study proved to be efficient in gaining an insight into the relationships between this class of beers and its flavor characteristics and revealed some subtle but clear differences among brands which took the lion's share of the market. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The results of this study have practical implications for brewers, importers and distributors. Brewers who wish to introduce or re-position a new or existing beer brand into the Italian market can benefit from these pieces of information to improve the knowledge of the sensory structure of the beer market to better plan their industrial strategies. Moskowitz stated that mapping technique can be used by researchers ``to identify which products compete with each other, as well as to discover whether or not there exist in the category unfilled holes that have promise.'' As competition intensifies, companies need to orientate more precisely and enhance more efficiently towards consumers' satisfaction and sensory properties of food and beverages are universally reported as determinants of product quality and acceptance.},

Eighteen beverages and three chocolates with 30\%, 70\%, and 99\% cocoa solids were hedonically rated by eighty regular chocolate consumers. The beverages were then paired with each chocolate, and the consumers were asked to indicate hedonic liking of the chocolates, beverages, and chocolate and beverage pairs, and to indicate whether the chocolate or beverage flavour dominated the pair. The results of this study showed that liking of chocolate and beverage pairs significantly varied (p b 0.001). Consumers preferred pairs with chocolate containing 30 and 70\% cocoa solids over pairs with chocolate containing 99\% cocoa solids. Beverages, such as balsamic vinegar, liqueur wine, coffee, and Port wine, generally appeared to be more proper and versatile partners for chocolate. According to the factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chocolate and beverage pair liking depended more on the beverage liking than the chocolate liking and the level of match. Omega squared indicated a medium effect for the beverage liking and a small effect for the chocolate liking, and the level of match. Although exploratory, this study outlined that when chocolate dominated the pair, a drop in acceptance is generally observed, whereas when the beverage dominates the chocolate a drop or a gain in acceptance can occur. Further investigations are required to complement the results with specific pieces of information on the flavour interactions that occur when chocolate and beverages are consumed according to a mixed tasting technique.},

The hedonic response varied significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) across combinations of cheese and beer pairs: Parmigiano cheese and Standard Lager were significantly preferred over other cheeses and beers, respectively. The hedonic liking of beer and cheese pairs was affected, in order of effect size, by beer liking, cheese type, flavour dominance, beer type, and beer type \^A cheese type interaction. Because the pairing was largely affected by beer preference, expert panellists were asked to explore the sensory properties of the beer with and without prior cheese consumption, using Parmigiano-Reggiano as a case study. Prior Parmigiano consumption showed a positive effect on beer liking, by modulating the perceived intensities of acidity, fruitiness, phenolic flavour, level of alcohol and carbonation, and sweetness. These outcomes are useful for engineering the most enjoyable pairing and to avoid intolerable mismatches, thus offering restaurateurs basic rules for aligning particular cheeses and beers in the marketplace.},

Food neophobia and familiarity with the dishes were measured to test whether these traits significantly influenced liking. The results showed that liking varied (p {$<$} .001) across individual dishes. The most liked dishes were all the first course dishes, braised loin with vegetable sauce, raw carrots and all the fruit courses except red orange juice. Least liked dishes were red orange juice, stir-fried spinaches and raw fennels. Liking scores correlated (p {$<$} .001) with children's food neophobia (r = -.38), familiarity (r = .94), sweetness (r = .72), odor (r = .70), and flavor intensity (r = .75).

Therefore, controlling for innate taste responses and favoring aromatic and rich-tasting dishes may improve liking. Additional interventions may focus on lowering children food neophobia by facilitating the exposure to unfamiliar foods.},

  abstract = {A standardized descriptive language for Cheddar cheese flavor was developed and validated. Representative Cheddar cheeses (240) were collected. Fifteen individuals from industry, academia, and government participated in a 3-d roundtable discussion to generate descriptive flavor terms. A highly trained descriptive panel (n = 11) refined the terms and identified references. Cheddar cheeses (24) were presented to the panel for validation with the identified lexicon. The panel differentiated the 24 Cheddar cheeses as determined by univariate and multivariate analysis of variance (P {$<$} 0.05). Twenty-seven terms were identified to describe Cheddar flavor. Seventeen descriptive terms were present in most Cheddar cheeses. A standard sensory language for Cheddar cheese will facilitate training and communication between different research groups.},

Development of a representative flavor lexicon requires several steps, including appropriate product frame of reference collection, language generation, and designation of definitions and references before a final descriptor list can be determined. Once developed, flavor lexicons can be used to record and define product flavor, compare products, and determine storage stability, as well as interface with consumer liking and acceptability and chemical flavor data.},

With continued production and consumption, there is also increased competition. Increased competition exists regionally, nationally, and globally. Processors as well as product developers must find ways to maximize existing markets and expand into new markets. A consistent high quality product is necessary to maintain competitiveness. Although microbial safety and stability are key ways to define quality, flavor is one method of defining quality that is often assumed or overlooked. The aggressive and competitive nature of today's market demands more precise and powerful tools for defining flavor and flavor quality. Traditional as well as more recent methods for evaluating dairy flavor are reviewed. The application of defining sensory flavors to fundamental research on flavor chemistry, product understanding, and effective marketing is addressed.},

The objective of this study was to compare differences and similarities in three independently developed sensory languages for Cheddar cheese flavour at three different locations (Ireland, New Zealand, United States of America) using an international selection of Cheddar cheeses. Twelve Cheddar cheeses (four from each country) were evaluated by the three panels using the respective sensory languages. Sensory space patterns obtained by principal component analysis were consistent between the three sites indicating that the overall differentiation of the cheeses by each panel was similar. The key flavour characteristics among the cheeses were described by different attributes. Cheeses were grouped by each site by country of origin suggesting international differences in Cheddar cheese flavour. Cross-cultural differences can exist in sensory language and perception, but highly trained panels using standardized, representative languages can provide comparable results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Flavor profiles of 29 representative sharp cheddar cheeses were documented by descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel. A total of 9 representative cheddar cheeses were selected and evaluated by consumers in 3 regional locations: east coast (Raleigh, N.C.; n = 150), midwest (Champaign, Ill.; n = 75), and west coast (Pullman, Wash.; n = 100). Consumers assessed the cheeses for overall liking and other consumer liking attributes. External preference mapping revealed 5 distinct consumer segments. The segment membership distribution between east coast and midwest consumers was similar while the west coast distribution was distinct (P {$<$} 0.05). A larger proportion of west coast consumers were present in segment 3, which consisted of consumers with specific likes for cheeses characterized by intense flavors of free fatty acid, brothy, and nutty flavors and salty and sour tastes. Consumer preferences in other segments differed from segment 3 due to their liking of at least 1 sensory attribute generally associated with young or mild cheddar cheese flavor. Key drivers of liking for these segments included whey flavor for segments 1 and 4 and milkfat flavor for segment 5. Segment 2 consumers liked most of the cheeses tested except those with dominant whey flavor. A sharp or aged cheddar cheese label means different things to different consumers and liking profiles are not defined by consumer location.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In the U.S.A., the production of processed cheese (PC) totaled 1,014 million kg in 2005. These products are made using natural cheese (NC), but imitation products are also available. Functionality and meltability are primary characteristics of these products, but flavor also plays a role. Studies have not focused on the flavor of these products. This study was conducted to identify and define the sensory properties of PC and imitation cheese (Imi). Three dairy experts evaluated 55 PC and Imi for initial language development. Following language development and refinement, 26 PC and Imi were selected and evaluated in triplicate by an experienced sensory panel (n{$\quad$}={$\quad$}8). Data were evaluated by analysis of variance with Fisher's least significant difference for means separation and by principal component analysis. Eighteen aromatics and five basic tastes were documented in the products. PC products, which are made from NC, were characterized by sweet aromatic, cooked/milky, caramelized/toasted cheese, diacetyl, whey, milkfat and brothy flavors. Imis that had casein/caseinates were distinguished by minty flavors and Imis with other protein sources were differentiated by cardboard and oxidized/fatty flavors. This study demonstrated an array of flavor profiles among PC and between PC and Imi. This flavor lexicon can help the industry to better define and differentiate PC and Imi and ultimately to help better understand consumer flavor preferences for these products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Processed cheese (PC) makes up a large market segment with processed cheese foods, spreads, and cold pack products and imitation products. These products are distinct from natural cheeses. This study established a defined descriptive flavor language for these products that can help cheese manufacturers understand the flavor profiles of different PC- and imitation cheese-type products.}

An objective lexical analysis, based on word and sentence correspondence, was used to analyse text from four group interviews and three summary reviews. Analysis of the interviews, concerning pig production and pork quality, gave 5 main contexts that contained 80\% of the original text. These related to `political', `quality' and `animal production', which were much broader contexts than indicated in the original questioning routes. The rural men group contributed significantly more to the political context and rural women more to the quality context data. Analysis of the summary reviews showed a simpler overall contextual structure but it depended on the reviewer. It is proposed that objective lexical analysis has a useful role to play in the interpretation of focus group interviews.},

  abstract = {Coming home to eat'' [Nabhan, 2002. Coming Home to Eat: The Pleasures and Politics of Local Foods. Norton, New York] has become a clarion call among alternative food movement activists. Most food activist discourse makes a strong connection between the localization of food systems and the promotion of environmental sustainability and social justice. Much of the US academic literature on food systems echoes food activist rhetoric about alternative food systems as built on alternative social norms. New ways of thinking, the ethic of care, desire, realization, and vision become the explanatory factors in the creation of alternative food systems. In these norm-based explanations, the ``Local'' becomes the context in which this type of action works. In the European food system literature about local ``value chains'' and alternative food networks, localism becomes a way to maintain rural livelihoods. In both the US and European literatures on localism, the global becomes the universal logic of capitalism and the local the point of resistance to this global logic, a place where ``embeddedness'' can and does happen. Nevertheless, as other literatures outside of food studies show, the local is often a site of inequality and hegemonic domination. However, rather than declaim the ``radical particularism'' of localism, it is more productive to question an ``unreflexive localism'' and to forge localist alliances that pay attention to equality and social justice. The paper explores what that kind of localist politics might look like.},

Undergraduate students (N = 324) completed the Food Involvement Scale and the Food Neophobia Scale measuring traits, and the Food Choice Questionnaire measuring specific motives. Daily food intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire two weeks later. General dietary healthfulness was based on its concordance with official recommendations. Regression analyses tested mediator and moderator relationships for each trait separately. The results partially support the mediation hypothesis: motives, such as Sensory Appeal and Health, mediated the effect of food involvement on intake of specific food categories. In addition, the relation of motives with both food intake and dietary healthfulness appeared to vary with level of food involvement or food neophobia (moderation). Implications to promote eating healthy food are discussed.},

Reliability of the FCQ-scales was moderate to good, but sometimes differed from the normative values. Item analysis pinpointed items with skewed distributions and low item-total correlations. Subsequent confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses revealed a suboptimal fit for the FCQ-model in all samples, with small to considerable divergences from the original configuration. The findings do not support the generalizability of the FCQ's factor structure, but suggest that its items and underlying constructs may have different connotations across western urban populations. Explanations for the lack of convergence in factor structure and implications for research are discussed.},

The tasks were (1) a vocabulary generation on a sample level, (2) an attribute identification task with a list of attributes to choose from, and (3) a descriptive analysis. The performance of the two panels was evaluated and compared using three parameters, as follows: Descriptive similarity, attribute knowledge similarity, and perceptual similarity. The results showed that the craft-style beer drinkers generated the most precise vocabulary and correctly identified more attributes, compared to the beer non-drinkers. Furthermore, the sample sensory spaces generated by the two panels were different before the training period, but were perceptually similar post training. To conclude, the beer consumption pattern influenced all aspects of panel performance before training, with the craftstyle panel performing better than the non-drinkers panel. However, the panels' performance became more similar after a short period of training sessions.},

The three measures of association are multivariate correlation coefficient, RV coefficient and Procrustes similarity index. A particular emphasis is put on RV coefficient since it is very popular among sensory scientists. We stress the properties and shortcomings of this coefficient and propose an adjusted RV coefficient to be used instead of RV coefficient, particularly in situations where the number of samples is small or/and the number of variables is large.},

Results of the study revealed people may be less variety-seeking than previous research suggests; in fact, diners were more likely to seek variety when choosing an individual item, but not when choosing a menu category. In other words, diners wanted to be different from their dining companions, but not too different. This result was further confirmed with a model of food choice which shows diners derived more utility from an entr\'ee when a fellow diner ordered an entr\'ee in the same category. Interestingly, the presence of calorie labels on menus did not change the marginal utility of calories, suggesting peer effects may outweigh the effects of nutritional information.},

Because eating patterns developed in childhood continue through adulthood, we need to form healthy eating habits in children. The objective of this study was to determine if offering vegetables before other meal components would increase the overall consumption of vegetables at school lunch. We served kindergarten through fifth-grade students a small portion (26\textendash 33~g) of a raw vegetable (red and yellow bell peppers) while they waited in line to receive the rest of their lunch meal. They then had the options to take more of the bell peppers, a different vegetable, or no vegetable from the lunch line. We measured the amount of each vegetable consumed by each child. Serving vegetables first greatly increased the number of students eating vegetables. On intervention days most of the vegetables consumed came from the vegetables-first portions. Total vegetable intake per student eating lunch was low because most students chose to not eat vegetables, but the intervention significantly increased this value. Serving vegetables first is a viable strategy to increase vegetable consumption in elementary schools. Long-term implementation of this strategy may have an important impact on healthy eating habits, vegetable consumption, and the health consequences of vegetable intake.},

  abstract = {The power of sensory discrimination methods'' (PSDM) was published in this journal in 1993. PSDM clarified the need for power considerations in the interpretation of testing results while providing a series of sample size tables. Despite the fact that the data considered in PSDM were binomially distributed, a normal approximation was used that both overestimated power and underestimated sample sizes. Although exact power functions have been examined in the sensory literature, the unusual behavior of these functions has not been embraced; the fact that increasing sample size can decrease power has not yet been incorporated into stable sample size recommendations. In this paper, we provide sample size recommendations with the property that any larger sample sizes also have the desired level of power. These recommendations are given in the form of tables updating those found in PSDM. In addition, a relatively new discrimination testing method known as the tetrad test has grown in popularity recently and this test now needs to be examined from a power perspective. We show that the tetrad test is remarkably powerful for an unspecified test and in some cases only requires one third the sample size as that required by the triangle test.},

  abstract = {A quantitative sensory method was developed to evaluate young red wines from Rioja Alavesa and find the most suitable attributes to describe them. Twenty-four attributes (including appearance, aroma, flavor, taste and mouthfeel attributes) were chosen. Combined quantitative references were developed for these attributes aiming to lower the total number of references to be tasted. Nineteen wines were evaluated at four different times (every 2.5 months after bottling) by a panel trained in the use of this methodology. Attributes were compared in terms of overall intensities, and discriminative power of the attributes was assessed by analysis of variance, considering both sample and time effects. Appearance, taste and mouthfeel attributes revealed to be the most important to describe and discriminate the wines. "Red berry," "floral," "aroma intensity" and "dark berry" were the most important aroma attributes to discriminate among the wines, whereas "alcoholic" and "herbaceous" were the most important in flavor.},

A representative sample (n = 190, aged 18\textendash 65 years), rated 50 food exemplars for naturalness (0\textendash 100 scale). Data were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA. Results support three hypotheses: chemical changes were more potent than physical changes; there was a minimal effect of mixing like entities and the more processing the greater the effect on consumer's deviation away from natural. Two hypotheses were validated conditionally: contagion accounts for naturalness reduction but is independent of dose above a certain level; E-numbers were always perceived to be less natural than the same preservatives described by chemical and common names; however, there were gender and some education interaction effects. The hypothesis that addition has a greater effect than removal was only partially validated. There was no evidence found to support the hypotheses that process has more effect than content, or that novel ingredients have a greater effect than `known' ingredients, however, this result may have been confounded. The implications for new manufactured food products, suggested by the results, are that products with physical changes, less processing, with like ingredients and described using common named descriptors for ingredients would be perceived to be more natural.},

This mixed methods study conducted in Vermont, a crucial player of the U.S. hard cider industry, addresses the gaps in the literature both on the apple supply side, and on the hard cider demand side. On the apple supply side, fourteen semi-structured interviews demonstrated that neither a long-term formalized contract nor a cooperative model (the two strategic partnership mechanisms used by world`s leading industries to manage cider-specific apple production) are appropriate for the current Vermont industry context. On the hard cider demand side, cider makers expressed high interest in working under a geographical indication (GI) label to develop consumers` hard cider literacy and increase demand. This research further indicates that GIs can act as a powerful economic development tool. Introducing hard cider GIs could address current hard cider industry issues on both the supply side and the demand side.},

Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive (disgusts) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are "contaminants": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e. g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a "contamination response."},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

This article compares the role of geographic distance and attachment value in consumer preferences for locally produced hard cider. Consumer valuations are estimated via a ``branded'' discrete choice experiment where the respondents chose between an in-state hard cider, an out-of-state hard cider, and a no buy option. Our measure of travel distance is based on the optimal driving route between each consumer's GPS location and the locations of the cideries while our attachment value measure is based on social capital theory. This allows us to analyze individual-specific travel distance heterogeneity in consumer choice as it relates to attachment value. Based on a latent class logit model estimated from a discrete choice experiment with 441 participants, we show that attachment value is higher for a cider produced within the state than for a cider produced outside the state. Furthermore, we show that increases in attachment value increase demand for locally produced hard cider more than an equal increase in attachment value for non-locally produced hard cider. Our findings are consistent with ``local'' preferences based on geopolitical boundaries (e.g., the state of Michigan) and not distance. (JEL Classifications: B55, M3, Q13, C83)},

Multidimensional scaling allows the perceptive dimensions to be retrieved from the similarities between the plastic pieces. A sensory interpretation of these dimensions is made possible by the consumers' verbal descriptions of their own groups. The proximity of the subjects' sorting results reveals the homogeneity of their perception of the products. On the other hand, 12 trained panelists generate and rate 8 visual attributes to describe a representative 8-piece subset of the 26 original samples, reduced to suit the descriptive analysis constraints. Eventually, both methods lead to the same conclusions in terms of piece configuration, associated perceptive interpretation and perception-process parameter relations.},

The first aim of this study was to investigate gender and cultural differences in verbal affective response to odors, measured with EOS and the usual pleasantness scale. To better understand this variability, the second aim was to investigate the link between affective reports and olfactory knowledge (familiarity and identification). Responses of 772 participants smelling 56\textendash 59 odors were collected in the three countries. Women rated odors as more intense and identified them better in all countries, but no reliable sex differences were found for verbal affective responses to odors. Disgust-related feelings revealed odor-dependent sex differences, due to sex differences in identification and categorization. Further, increased odor knowledge was related to more positive affects as reported with pleasantness and odor-related feeling evaluations, which can be related to top-down influences on odor representation. These top-down influences were thought, for example, to relate to beliefs about odor properties or to categorization (edible vs. nonedible). Finally, the link between odor knowledge and olfactory affect was generally asymmetrical and significant only for pleasant odors, not for unpleasant ones that seemed to be more resistant to cognitive influences. This study, for the first time using emotional scales that are appropriate to the olfactory domain, brings new insights into the variability of affective responses to odors and its relationship to odor knowledge.},

  abstract = {The meal is universal, existing in every society, culture and social class, but its symbolic meanings differ across individuals and groups. Encyclopaedias define a meal as a certain amount of food eaten at a specific time, some researchers define the meal as part of the eating space, and some by nutritionally distinguishing meals from eating events, such as snacks. Meal patterns and meal orders in Sweden have changed considerably over the centuries according to historical evidence. In modern society there is a tendency towards increased grazing behaviour and perhaps also towards a decrease in sharing family meals, but these phenomena require further investigation. Research on meals, or ``meal research'', has been developed and now represents two new academic disciplines in Sweden. The first department to establish this new academic discipline by establishing a professorship was the Department of Domestic Sciences, Uppsala University. The aim of meal research is to take a holistic perspective on nutrition and food studies, to which studies at the department have contributed during the past decade.},

Here, we compare the results of three rapid sensory profiling techniques \textendash{} check-all-that-apply (CATA), sorting, and polarized sensory positioning (PSP) \textendash{} using a diverse range of astringent stimuli. These rapid methods differ in their theoretical basis, implementation, and data analyses, and the relative advantages and limitations are largely unexplored. Additionally, we were interested in using these methods to compare varied astringent stimuli, as these compounds are difficult to characterize using traditional descriptive analysis due to high fatigue and potential carry-over. In the CATA experiment, subjects (n = 41) were asked to rate the overall intensity of each stimulus as well as to endorse any relevant terms (from a list of 13) which characterized the sample. In the sorting experiment, subjects (n = 30) assigned intensity-matched stimuli into groups 1-on-1 with the experimenter. In the PSP experiment, (n = 41) subjects first sampled and took notes on three blind references (`poles') before rating each stimulus for its similarity to each of the 3 poles. Two-dimensional perceptual maps from correspondence analysis (CATA), multidimensional scaling (sorting), and multiple factor analysis (PSP) were remarkably similar, with normalized RV coefficients indicating significantly similar plots, regardless of method. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering of all data sets using Ward's minimum variance as the linkage criteria showed the clusters of astringent stimuli were approximately based on the respective class of astringent agent. Based on the descriptive CATA data, it appears these differences may be due to the presence of side tastes such as bitterness and sourness, rather than astringent sub-qualities per se. Although all three methods are considered `rapid', our prior experience with sorting suggests it is best performed 1:1 with the experimenter, which makes sorting relatively less efficient than CATA or PSP. Based on the evaluation criteria used here, the choice of method depends on the time constraints of the experimenter and the need for descriptive terms to understand the sensory space of the samples. Accordingly, we recommend a mixed approach that combines CATA with a subsequent PSP task so that the product space can be well characterized before choosing poles for PSP.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined the impact of increasing beverage portion size on beverage and food intake. Subjects Thirty-three subjects, 18 women and 15 men, were included. Intervention In a crossover design, subjects consumed lunch in the laboratory once a week for 6 weeks. At each test lunch, the same foods were served, but the beverage served was varied in type (cola, diet cola, or water) and portion size (360 g/12 fl oz or 540 g/18 fl oz). Main outcome measures Beverage intake (g); energy intake from foods and beverages (kcal); and ratings of hunger, satiety, and characteristics of the foods and beverages served. Results Increasing beverage portion size significantly increased the weight of beverage consumed, regardless of the type of beverage served (PϽ0.05). As a consequence, for the caloric beverage, energy intake from the beverage increased by 10\% for women and 26\% for men when there was a 50\% increase in the portion served (PϽ0.01). Food intake did not differ between conditions, so when the energy from the caloric beverage was added to the energy from food, total energy intake at lunch was increased significantly (PϽ0.001) compared with noncaloric beverages. Conclusions Serving a larger portion of beverage resulted in increased beverage consumption, and increased energy intake from the beverage when a caloric beverage was served. Serving a caloric beverage resulted in an overall increase in total energy consumed at lunch. Therefore, replacing caloric beverages with low-calorie or noncaloric beverages can be an effective strategy for decreasing energy intake.},

To date, no investigation has directly tested in an experimentally-controlled setting whether participants can detect different terroirs in wines, and if their level of expertise can modulate such performance. We investigated wine olfactory discrimination ability by using a computercontrolled olfactometer. Participants' ability to discriminate two wines only based on the olfactory features of their terroir (zone and vineyard), their variety (e.g., cabernet vs. merlot) or both was tested. Olfactory discrimination performance of both novices and wine-professionals reflected whether two wines differed by terroir, variety or both. Performance peaked when wines differed in both terroir and variety, with terroir being more easily discriminated than variety. These results, obtained by controlling for the first time the precision of the olfactory stimulation, provide insightful clues in understanding the wine appreciation process, specifically with respect to the perceptual aspects of terroir.},

Because of its commercial availability and consumer familiarity, red iceberg lettuce was chosen as the control for comparison with amaranth, huauzontle, pac choi, tai sai, arugula, mizuna and komatsuna. For a majority of the greens, more than 50\% of panelists reported appearance, texture and overall acceptability of the samples as highly acceptable or acceptable. Flavor, however, had lower values. There were no significant differences in overall acceptability among five taxa (amaranth, pac choi, tai sai, mizuna and komatsuna) compared with red iceberg lettuce; however, the mean appearance values of five greens (komatsuna, mizuna, arugula, tai sai and pac choi) were higher than red iceberg (P~{$<~$}0.05). Panelists' flavor perceptions were strongly correlated with overall acceptability of the greens. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study demonstrated that selected specialty leafy greens (amaranth, huauzontle, pac choi, tai sai, arugula, mizuna, komatsuna and red iceberg lettuce) have desirable sensory attributes that are comparable with traditional greens available in the market. This suggests potential for commercial production and marketing of the selected specialty leafy greens.},

These questions are crucially important both for efforts in food innovation and for institutions that face consequences and costs of diets that are harmful to human health and to the environment. On these matters, several reports have been developed following the angel of various disciplines, focusing on the analysis of the factors affecting food choices. Large-scale research on consumption behaviours has neither stopped the growing number of unsuccessful products entering the market, nor provided adequate support for institutions that are taking elaborate actions towards promoting health-orientated behaviours. These preliminary remarks highlight the need to think about the approaches and categories with which research programmes on food choices should be updated. This article discusses the reasons why food choices are determined by beliefs and identity, are conditioned by social images that influence preferences by indicating to individuals what foods are `good' and `right'; belong to the field of individual choice, and therefore, cannot be assimilated into medical prescriptions or merely reduced to a question of rules. Taste involves beliefs and identity as well as perceptions. This is why it has to be analyzed as a cultural and relational object. This paper aims to explore the complex mix of influences on food choice stressing that food choice is a matter of identity.},

However, it can be undesirable to construct liking studies where each panelist evaluates every target product. In such cases, an incomplete-block design, where each panelist evaluates only a subset of the target products, can be used. These incomplete blocks are often balanced, so that all pairs occur the same number of times. While desirable in many situations, balanced incomplete blocks have the disadvantage that, by their nature, they cannot favor placing dissimilar products next to one another. A novel incomplete-block design is introduced that utilizes the target product's sensory profile to allocate products to each panelist so that they are, in general, as dissimilar as possible while also ensuring position balance. The resulting design is called a sensory informed design (SID). Herein, details on the formulation of SIDs are given. Data arising from these SIDs are analyzed using a simultaneous clustering and imputation approach, and the results are discussed.},

We compare this modelbased approach to the current state-of-the-art imputation procedures using two real data sets that arose from central location tests. These data sets contain missing values by design. In addition, these data sets have two data sets nested within each of them. We use these nested data sets to validate the results. Compared to the considered state-of-the-art imputation procedures, we find evidence that the model-based approach is able to recover the group structure and key characteristics of the data sets when a high percentage of the data are missing.},

Moreover, ethnography allows a deeper understanding of the cultural background of food choice processes in a studied culture. Using Japan as a case study, this research demonstrates the use of ethnography to argue that variety is a primary motive for food choice in contemporary Japanese culture. Variety is hence regarded here as a part of a larger food culture attribute, an ``adventurous palate,'' which can also provide a background for previous FCQ findings (Prescott, Young, O'neill, Yau, \&amp; Stevens, 2002).},

Data from the interviews are presented to illustrate the structure of this conceptual model. People's life course experiences affected major influences on food choice that included ideals, personal factors, resources, social contexts and the food context. These influences informed the development of personal systems for making food choices that incorporated value negotiations and behavioral strategies. Value negotiations weighed sensory perceptions, monetary considerations, health and nutrition beliefs and concerns, convenience, social relationships and quality of food choice decisions. Strategies employed to simplify the food choice process developed over time. The conceptual food choice process model represents the rich and complex bases of food practices, and provides a theoretical framework for research and practice in nutrition.},

  abstract = {Many French wines, and now other kinds of agricultural products, manifest the process of "patrimonialization" as a counterforce to the homogenizing trends in the globalization of world food systems. The appellation controlee (AOC) concept, which dates from 1935, is the oldest expression of that patrimonial process. In it, the characteristics of a place-the terroir-are used to gloss its legally protected, territorial definition on which hinge claims to a place-based product authenticity and, by extension, quality. AOC implementation, now with almost seven decades of experience in France, serves as the model to understand how the application of terroir to place has focused on land-use practice, wine definition, vinicultural tradition, and landscape preservation. A complementary process at work is product salience that establishes its individuality in an interactive expectation between producer and consumer. Fieldwork in the commune of Cassis (Department of Bouches-du-Rhone) in the South of France sorted the set of historical, environmental, and economic conditions to reveal the actual functioning of these two processes at a local level. Appellation Cassis controlee, the third oldest and one of the smallest AOC in French viniculture, comprises 180 ha of vineyards and fourteen wine growers. In this case, establishment of product authenticity has been a continuous process. Wine types have evolved in spite of the absence of real innovation; political territory has been used to define terroir; the discourse of quality depends heavily on the historic past; vineyards have acquired a community value beyond any productivity; and producers have defined and defended their territory to boost its prestige to themselves and their consumers. The key entity in the appellation is the lower winegrowers syndicate. Presumptive statements, promotional rhetoric, consumer desire, and the politics of local decision making have shaped this wine region far beyond its environmental associations.},

It was the aim of this study to dynamically characterize 4 wines as they would be perceived when consumed with and without cheese. The tasting protocol was based on multi-intake temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) coupled with hedonic rating. In the 1st session, 31 French wine and cheese consumers evaluated the wines (Pacherenc, Sancerre, Bourgogne, and Madiran) over 3 consecutive sips. In the following sessions, they performed the same task, but eating small portions of cheese (Epoisses, Comte\textasciiacute, Roquefort, Crottin de Chavignol) between sips. All cheeses were tasted with all wines over 4 sessions. TDS data were mainly analyzed in terms of each attribute's duration of dominance by analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of variance, and canonical variate analysis. Results showed that cheese consumption had an impact (P {$<$} 0.1) on dominance duration of attributes and on preference for most wines. For example, in Madiran, all cheeses reduced dominance duration (P {$<$} 0.01) of astringency and sourness and increased duration of red fruit aroma. Although the number of consumers was small to make extended general conclusions on wine's preference, significant changes were observed before and after cheese intake.},

Three wines (one white, Pouilly Loch\'e; and two red, Maranges and Beaujolais) and three cheeses (Comt\'e, \'Epoisses, Chaource) were individually evaluated by a group of 60 consumers using mono-intake Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) with simultaneous hedonic ratings. The same data acquisition screen was used for all products showing a unique list of 14 descriptors (covering cheese and wine perception) and a hedonic scale for dynamical rating of liking. The dynamic hedonic data were associated with the TDS profiles obtaining Temporal Drivers of Liking (TDL). Furthermore, the nine associations that resulted from combining each wine with each cheese were evaluated by multi-bite and multi-sip TDS. Individually, Chaource had practically no TDL; for Comt\'e, mushroom flavor was a positive TDL, and in \'Epoisses, salty was a negative TDL. As for wines, negative TDL were only found in the red wines: bitter, sour and astringent. Positive TDL for wines were: fruity, spicy and woody. Changes in the dynamic perception had a bigger impact on liking of wine compared to cheese. For the associations, the negative TDL were only three and mostly wine related: sour (for seven out of nine combinations), bitter (six out of nine) and astringent (five out of nine). Positive TDL were more varied (a total of 10 descriptors) and were related either to wine or cheese. As opposed to what was found in cheese alone, salty was a positive TDL in two of the combinations. It was observed that the dynamic sensory perception had a more important impact on liking in wine-cheese combinations than when consumed separately. TDS and TDL have a big potential in the study of food pairing, which should be further exploited.},

  abstract = {Although sensory appeal influences peanut consumption, peanut varieties are mostly selected based on agronomic traits. As a result, the sensory properties of peanut varieties, especially in southern Africa, are not known. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to determine the sensory properties of the Malawi peanut varieties and the volatile compounds associated with roasted peanut flavor. Six dominant Malawi peanut varieties (Chalimbana, CG7, Nsinjiro, Kakoma, Baka, and Chitala) were evaluated in this study. All peanut samples were shelled and then, roasted in a convection oven to reach medium doneness as indicated by the surface color lightness (L) value of approximately 50. A hybrid descriptive analysis (DA) was done to determine the sensory profile of the roasted peanuts. Volatile compounds were extracted from equilibrated ground peanut sample using headspace-solid phase microextraction technique and analyzed by GC-MS. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the DA data showed significant differences (P {$<$} 0.05) in the sensory profiles of the peanut varieties. Nsinjiro and Baka had a significantly higher intensity of roasted peanutty aroma and flavor (P {$<$} 0.05). The GC-MS results showed that pyrazines and furans were the dominant volatile compounds but, their respective concentrations, in the evaluated peanut varieties, were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.05). Among the pyrazines, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine was strongly correlated with roasted peanutty flavor (r = 0.927) just like 2,5 dimethyl pyrazine (r = 0.916). Therefore, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine and 2,5-dimethyl pyrazine production pathways could provide more insights into the origins of roasted peanut flavor.},

However, for their experiments to have the needed external validity to achieve such marketing objectives, food scientists must incorporate into their experiments certain elements of consumer purchase behavior and the marketing context in which food products are considered for purchase. In this paper, we discuss those aspects of consumer choice behavior and the marketplace that are pertinent to accurately predicting consumer food purchase behavior, and how they may be incorporated into experimental studies aimed at predicting food preference and choice.},

The results obtained showed that the mode\'ls explanatory capacity did not increase significantly when the new wine was tested (product testing) in comparison to when only information about the wine was presented (concept testing). In both cases, the variables that explain purchase intention are the same. These results have important practical implications and open new research lines that can contribute to the theories that try to explain the acceptance of new foods.},

The four wines differed significantly ( p {$<$} 0.05) in citrus fruit aroma intensities. The descriptor terms generated in this study differed from terms associated with Petit Manseng wine produced in France. GC-MS analysis showed differences in 30 volatile compounds detected and analyzed in the wines. Nine of these compounds had odor activity values greater than 1.0, and may have contributed to the aroma of the Petit Manseng wines.

  abstract = {Appropriateness of use evaluations can be used to explore consumers' associations between products and usage situations. The degree of familiarity consumers have with a certain product has recently been suggested as a mediator of these evaluations, influencing both the number and the type of associations consumers hold with food and beverages. In this work, we extend previous results across multiple product categories, hereby generalizing the findings. Four consumer studies were conducted using fruit names (N = 246), white wine images (N = 112), chocolate bar images (N = 192), and kiwifruit images (N = 302) as test stimuli. In each study, consumers rated their perceived familiarity with each stimulus and evaluated the appropriateness of use in a range of situations relevant to the product category. Familiarity was confirmed as a moderator of appropriateness of use evaluations, and was positively linked to product versatility. Since familiarity is related to an individual's exposure to a product, this could indicate that consumers use past experience with a product as a heuristic for their appropriateness evaluations. The variance in appropriateness evaluations explained by familiarity alone was, however, limited, and product-context associations were also contingent upon specific product characteristics. Taken together, the four studies reported here confirm that product familiarity is related to usage versatility, and indicate that consumers may find it challenging to envisage how unfamiliar food products can be incorporated into their existing dietary practices.},

  abstract = {Aroma perception is a determinant factor in food choices and acceptability by consumers. To be perceived, aroma compounds must be released in the mouth during food breakdown, transferred into the nasal cavity to reach the olfactory receptor and then be perceived. So, in order to control aroma perception, knowledge of the main factors that can influence in-mouth aroma release is of major importance. Focusing on dairy products, this review article investigates the factors due to: (i) food products, and mainly the influence of food composition and structure on aroma retention and release; (ii) the interindividual variability of subjects, mainly chewing behaviour, saliva rate and composition and their influence on aroma release; and (iii) the interactions between food products and subjects and their impact on aroma release and perception. We also discuss the various instrumental and sensory methodologies that are often used to study aroma\textendash texture interactions in dairy products, with particular focus on articles that compare in vivo aroma release and perception in dairy products. This review emphasizes that the relationship existing between in vivo aroma release and perception in dairy products is strongly dependent on the type of texture relative to two mechanisms; physicochemical mechanisms based on the modification of aroma release and a cognitive mechanism based on aroma\textendash taste\textendash texture interactions. These two mechanisms exist simultaneously but have more or less impact on aroma perception, depending on the type of texture. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Many approaches to deal with this kind of complex network data structure are reported in the literature. In this paper, we propose the use of factorial methods to visually explore the complex structure of multiplex networks. Specifically, the adjacency matrices derived from multiplex networks are analyzed using the DISTATIS technique, an extension of multidimensional scaling to three-way data. This technique allows the representation of the different types of relationships in both separate spaces for each layer and a compromise space. The analytical procedure is illustrated using a real world example and simulated data.},

  abstract = {What are local foods? If you do not know your local producer, then how can you know whether the product you are purchasing is local? These questions are at the heart of an emerging debate in the United States about authenticity and the value of local eating. In the United States, from the menus of its elite restaurants, to urban farmer markets, to the procurement strategy of its largest corporation, ``local'' is fast becoming an important food category. Several distinct forces drive its popularity and yet, in the absence of certain credence attributes to assure what indeed is local, its future is uncertain. This article explores what defines ``local'' and how the term is protected in trade. It suggests that intellectual property protection is underdeveloped to foster local food product designations. Cases in the United States illustrate that some viable mechanisms do exist to ensure the specific provenance of a food but that in large interconnected markets these mechanisms present some notable challenges for both producers and consumers. In its review of different approaches to protecting and fostering local food systems, the article finds that geographical indications (GIs) may be more conducive to local food systems because they are not owned but rather attributed, and, in this way, even smaller producers have access to the marketing potential of a GI label. Improving approaches to GIs in the United States, perhaps learning from the sui generis systems in other countries, could further the development, protection, and success of local products.},

Proper modeling allows a good understanding of the consumer preferences, the identification of consumer segments and the optimization of products, and, eventually, offers opportunities for competitive advantage. However, in the analysis of choice data, products that are mixtures of ingredients have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we combine traditional choice models and traditional mixture models. We apply the resulting mixture choice models to data from a real-life experiment in which consumers made pair-wise comparisons involving seven cocktails. For the choice models, we first assume consumer homogeneity. Next, we allow for heterogeneity among individuals. Therefore, we discuss the multinomial logit model, the mixed logit model and the latent class model. For identifying segments, besides the latent class model, we explore various two-stage segmentation approaches in which forces, hierarchical Bayes estimates and Firth individual-level estimates are used as input for a cluster analysis. The results show that the mixed logit model and the latent class model describe the data better than the multinomial logit model. The optimal cocktails for the segments we identified using the various methods are not identical, but show many similarities.},

As a case study we apply RF to the predictive discrimination of six typical cheeses of the Trentino province (North Italy) from data obtained by quantitative descriptive analysis. The corresponding sensory profiling was carried out by eight trained assessors using a developed language containing 35 attributes. We compare RFs discrimination capabilities with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and discriminant partial least square (dPLS). The RF models result more accurate, with smaller prediction errors than LDA and dPLS. RF also offers the possibility of graphically analyzing the developed models with multi-dimensional scaling plots based on an internal measure of similarity between samples. We compare these plots with similar ones derived from principal component analysis and LDA, finding that the same qualitative information can be extracted from all methods. The RF model also gives an estimation of the relative importance of each sensory attribute for the discriminant function. We couple this measure with an appropriate experimental setup in order to obtain an unbiased and stable method for variable selection. We favorably compare this method with sequential selection based on LDA models.},

  abstract = {Product classification based on sensory evaluations can play an important role in quality control or typicality assessment. Unfortunately its real world applications face the difficulties related to the cost of a proper sensory approach. To partially overcome these issues we propose to build discriminant models based on the evaluation of single assessors and develop an appropriate method to combine them. We compare this new strategy with the more traditional one based on the panel average. We consider as applicative examples two datasets obtained from the sensory assessment of diverse cheese typologies from North Italy by two different panels. Also, we apply diverse, innovative and noise-resistant discriminant methods (random forest, penalized discriminant analysis and discriminant partial least squares) to show that our new strategy based on modeling each individual assessor is efficient and that this result is independent of the classifier being used. The main finding of our work is that using noise-resistant multivariate methods, product discrimination based on the combination of independent models built for each assessor is never worse than discrimination based on panel average and that the error reduction is higher in the case of low consonance between assessors. Experiments on the same datasets adding random uniform values (noise) with different intensities support these findings. We also discuss a demonstrative experiment using different sets of attributes for each assessor. Overall, our results suggest that, if the goal is product classification, the consonance among assessors or even the use of the same vocabulary seem not necessary, the key factor being the discrimination capability and repeatability of each judge.},

Those attributes are organized in terms of schemas and semantic networks, respectively. To elicit the semantic networks, we apply the innovative, qualitative graphing procedure `concept mapping' to visualize consumers' semantic networks. We choose pork quality as a research object. In this context, we conducted a survey on the private household level in 2004. Content analysis is used to uncover which quality characteristics are stored in memory. The importance and relative positions of certain attributes within the semantic networks are determined by means of network analysis. This approach enables us to uncover the relations between quality cues and experience and credence quality attributes. The results show that consumers prefer intrinsic quality cues to predict experience quality attributes. In contrast to that extrinsic quality cues are used to predict credence quality attributes. Furthermore, our analysis shows that consumers' semantic networks are quite complex and heterogeneous.},

The resulting scale, which we refer to as the oral labeled magnitude scale (LMS), is characterized by a non-linear spacing among its verbal descriptors that, like Borg's (1982) category-ratio scale, is roughly logarithmic. The LMS was evaluated by comparing it with the method of magnitude estimation in an experiment in which subjects rated the intensity of sensations of sweetness, chemical irritation and cold. The psychophysical functions produced by the two methods were not statistically different, indicating that the oral LMS yielded ratio-level data comparable to that produced by magnitude estimation. A final experiment demonstrated the importance of the spacing among semantic descriptors by showing that both the psychophysical functions and the semantic information about perceptual intensity were altered when the descriptors were equally spaced. Theoretical and practical issues related to the empirical approach to scale construction and the generality and robustness of the oral LMS are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Labeled Magnitude Scale (LMS) is a semantic scale of perceptual intensity characterized by a quasi-logarithmic spacing of its verbal labels. The LMS had previously been shown to yield psychophysical functions equivalent to magnitude estimation (ME) when gustatory, thermal and nociceptive stimuli were presented and rated together, and the upper bound of the LMS was defined as the 'strongest imaginable oral sensation'. The present study compared the LMS to ME within the more limited contexts of taste and smell. In Experiment 1, subjects used both methods to rate either taste intensity produced by sucrose and NaCI or odor intensity produced by acetic acid and phenyl ethyl alcohol, with the upper bound of the LMS defined as either the 'strongest imaginable taste' or the 'strongest imaginable odor'. The LMS produced psychophysical functions equivalent to those produced by ME. In Experiment 2 a new group of subjects used both methods to rate the intensity of three different taste qualities, with the upper bound of the LMS defined as the 'strongest imaginable [sweetness, saltiness, or bitterness]'. In all three cases the LMS produced steeper functions than did ME. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that the LMS yields data comparable to ME only when the perceptual domain under study includes painful sensations. This hypothesis was supported when the LMS again produced steeper functions than ME after subjects had been explicitly instructed to omit painful sensations (e.g. the 'burn' of hot peppers) from the concept of 'strongest imaginable taste'. We conclude that the LMS can be used to scale sensations of taste and smell when they are broadly defined, but that it should be modified for use in scaling specific taste (and probably odor) qualities. The implications of these results for theoretical issues related to ME, category-ratio scales and the size of the perceptual range in different sensory modalities are discussed. Chem.

  abstract = {It is posed that protein intake is tightly regulated by the human body. The role of sensory qualities in the satiating effects of protein, however, requires further clarification. Our objective was to determine the effect of within-meal protein content and taste on subsequent food choice and satiety. We used a cross-over design whereby sixty healthy, unrestrained subjects (twenty-three males and thirty-seven females) with a mean age of 20{$\cdot$}8 (SD 2{$\cdot$}1) years and a mean BMI of 21{$\cdot$}5 (SD 1{$\cdot$}6) kg/m2 were offered one of four isoenergetic preloads (rice meal) for lunch: two low in protein (about 7 \% energy derived from protein) and two high in protein (about 25 \% energy from protein). Both had a sweet and savoury version. At 30 min after preload consumption, subjects were offered an ad libitum buffet, consisting of food products differing in protein content (low/high) and taste (sweet/savoury). In addition, the computerised Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) was run to assess several components of food reward. The results showed no effect of protein content of the preloads on subsequent food choice. There was an effect of taste; after eating the savoury preloads, choice and intake of sweet products were higher than of savoury products. No such preference was seen after the sweet preloads. No differences in satiety were observed. To conclude, within one eating episode, within-meal protein content in these quantities seems not to have an effect on subsequent food choice. This appears to be mostly determined by taste, whereby savoury taste exerts the strongest modulating effect. The results of the LFPQ provided insight into underlying processes.},

The aim of this study was to obtain a consumer-driven definition for the concept of TFP and innovation and to compare these across six European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Poland and Spain) by means of semantic and textual statistical analyses. Twelve focus groups were performed, two per country, under similar conditions. The transcriptions obtained were submitted to an ordinary semantic analysis and to a textual statistical analysis using the software ALCESTE. Four main dimensions were identified for the concept of TFP: habit-natural, originlocality, processing-elaboration and sensory properties. Five dimensions emerged around the concept of innovation: novelty-change, variety, processing-technology, origin-ethnicity and convenience. TFP were similarly perceived in the countries analysed, while some differences were detected for the concept of innovation. Semantic and statistical analyses of the focus groups led to similar results for both concepts. In some cases and according to the consumers' point of view the application of innovations may damage the traditional character of TFP.},

Frequencies of occurrence of associations were obtained and analysed by means of simple correspondence analysis. The different word associations obtained were classified in 55 classes and then grouped in ten principal dimensions by triangulation. In general, southern European regions tended to associate the concept of ``Traditional'' more frequently with broad concepts such as heritage, culture or history. Central and Nordic European regions tended to focus mainly on practical issues such as convenience, health or appropriateness. As a final outcome of the analyses, a consensus conceptual map of traditional food products was obtained.

To this end, we generated labeled magnitude scales for assessing the magnitude of oral sensations of wetness, dryness, pleasantness and unpleasantness. Seventy-three subjects provided magnitude estimates for seven intensity descriptors, randomly interspersed with examples of various nonpainful oral sensations, which were rated also. Twenty of the subjects provided ratings for all four scales twice during four days of testing. Analysis of these subjects' data indicated that the ratings of the intensity descriptors significantly varied (F6,1045 = 688.00, p {$<$} 0.001), but were similar for all four scales (F18,1045 = 0.64, p = 0.87). Fifty-three of the 73 subjects provided data without replications, or data for only two of the four scales. The complete dataset was divided into separate analyses for wetness/dryness scales (OWDS; n = 51 subjects) and for pleasantness/unpleasantness scales (OPUS; n = 49). Results did not differ from those of the 20 subjects described above. Additionally, no effects of gender or sensitivity to 6-n-propyl-2-thiouractil (PROP) upon the ratings were seen. The mean ratings of the 51 and 49 subjects were used to define label positions on the OWDS and OPUS, respectively. Comparison of the two scales with the LMS [Green, B. G., Shaffer, G., \& Gilmore, M. M. (1993). Derivation and evaluation of a sematic scale of oral sensation magnitude with apparent ratio properties. Chemical Senses 18, 683\textendash 702] and the LAM scale [Schutz, H. G., \& Cardello, A. V. (2001). A labeled affective magnitude (LAM) scale for assessing food liking/disliking. Journal of Sensory Studies 16, 117\textendash 159] indicates that positions of labels for OWDS and OPUS are similar to those for the LAM. The OWDS and OPUS labels are shifted toward the upper end of the scale, considerably so when compared with the LMS. This suggests that using the LMS to rate oral wetness, dryness, pleasantness or unpleasantness would underestimate the intensities of relatively weak sensations.},

However, accurate predictions have been achieved only for a small number of descriptors. Here, we show that applying natural-language semantic representations on a small set of general olfactory perceptual descriptors allows for the accurate inference of perceptual ratings for mono-molecular odorants over a large and potentially arbitrary set of descriptors. This is noteworthy given that the prevailing view is that humans' capacity to identify or characterize odors by name is poor. We successfully apply our semantics-based approach to predict perceptual ratings with an accuracy higher than 0.5 for up to 70 olfactory perceptual descriptors, a ten-fold increase in the number of descriptors from previous attempts. These results imply that the semantic distance between descriptors defines the equivalent of an odorwheel.},

  abstract = {As the free sorting task becomes more common in sensory science, methodological research is needed to determine best practices for the test. Previous studies have shown that asking attribute-specific, ``analytical'' questions can bias the answers participants give to later ``holistic'' questions in a survey. For the free sorting task, this has led researchers to recommend only asking subjects to label or describe groups of products after they have finished sorting, but this approach is not based on empirical research. The present study investigated whether the separation of sorting and labeling steps is necessary by having 80 panelists sort 12 cold brew coffee samples in 3 conditions: labeling and describing the groups afterwards, at the same time, or not at all. Results were analyzed with DISTATIS, Hierarchical DISTATIS, and permutation tests. This work is novel in investigating the effect of labeling instructions on sorting results and provides some interesting insight into sensory impact of coffee bean parameters on cold brew coffees. No configurational differences were found based on the timing of labeling instructions and 38\% of panelists labeled their groups without being told, suggesting future researchers may request that subjects label when convenient. While the most distinctive samples were the dark roast coffees, a large subgroup (n = 36) sorted the coffee samples partially based on country of origin. Given the lack of effect from different sorting instructions and the tendency for spontaneous, simultaneous labeling, simultaneous labeling is suggested as best practice for future sorting tasks.},

  abstract = {As sensory evaluation relies upon humans accurately communicating their sensory experience, the diverse and overlapping vocabulary of flavor descriptors remains a major challenge. The lexicon generation protocols used in methods like Descriptive Analysis are expensive and time-consuming, while the post-facto analyses of natural vocabulary in ``quick and dirty'' methods like Free Choice or Flash Profiling require considerable subjective decision-making on the part of the analyst. A potential alternative for producing lexicons and analyzing the sensory attributes of products in nonstandardized text can be found in Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP tools allow for the analysis of larger volumes of free text with fewer subjective decisions. This paper describes the steps necessary to automatically collect, clean, and analyze existing product descriptions from the web. As a case study, online reviews of international whiskies from two prominent websites (2309 reviews from WhiskyCast and 4289 reviews from WhiskyAdvocate) were collected, preprocessed to only retain potentially-descriptive nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and then the final term list was grouped into a flavor wheel using Correspondence Analysis and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The wheel is compared to an existing Scotch flavor wheel. The ease of collecting nonstandardized descriptions of products and the improved speed of automated methods can facilitate collection of descriptive sensory data for products where no lexicon exists.

It discusses recent research that indicates that the Theory of Planned Behaviour and its derivatives have restricted validity as a predictor of food consumers' evaluations and purchase patterns. This has significant implications as Planned Behaviour is the dominant paradigm within food industry research. The article demonstrates that Planned Behaviour has acquired this status more by default than by proven merit. The specific reasons for the failure of Planned Behaviour are discussed. An alternative paradigm, Cue-Based Decision Making is developed from an existing literature, and is proposed as a basis for increasing our understanding of the uninvolved food consumer in order to predict and influence their behaviour.},

  abstract = {Immersive environments may restore relevant context during consumer sensory testing and hence, could yield better discrimination and reliability in acceptance tests compared to traditional methods. To date, no study has compared hedonic data from these settings to those obtained in an actual consumption environment. Presently, sixty-two red-wine consumers evaluated the same 4 wines in 3 environments\textemdash a traditional sensory booth, an immersive wine bar, and an actual wine bar. For each wine, subjects evaluated overall liking, future consumption habits, and price estimation. Interestingly, wine liking did not differ across the three environments (p\,=\,0.076) nor was there a significant wine by environment interaction (p\,=\,0.955). However, at the individual level, wine liking was less stable. For each subject, the magnitude of difference in liking scores for each wine was calculated between two environments. On average, the greatest difference in liking scores occurred between the traditional booths and the actual wine bar (1.7\,{$\pm$}\,0.1) and was significantly greater than the difference in liking scores between the booths and immersive wine bar (1.4\,{$\pm$}\,0.1, p\,=\,0.008); the liking difference between the immersive and actual wine bar (1.6\,{$\pm$}\,0.1) was intermediate. Consumption behavior was also differentially impacted by environment. Subjects were more willing to order the wines at a wine bar when evaluating in the actual environment compared to the traditional booths (p\,=\,0.035). However, environment did not influence the subject's willingness to purchase the wine to drink at home (p\,=\,0.064). Generally, consumers were able to accurately differentiate price amongst the wines (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) but estimated the wines at a higher price point in the actual environment compared to the traditional (p\,=\,0.049). Overall, results suggest wine liking scores across environments were stable within the population, whereas greater variability was observed in individuals when comparing liking scores between traditional booths and the actual environment. Due to the marginal effect of the environment additional research is needed to evaluate the use of immersive technologies and better understand under which conditions context is important.},

This work sought to characterize a range of enological tannins and their contribution to wine quality. Enological tannins were analysed for protein precipitable tannins and iron reactive phenolics. One tannin product was added to a Merlot wine during barrel ageing, at a range of concentrations from 60 to 300 mg/l. Condensed and hydrolysable tannins were added to Cabernet Sauvignon wine post-pressing at a recommended and excessive rate. Wines were analysed for anthocyanin, small and large polymeric pigment, precipitable tannin, iron reactive phenolics and sensory character. Enological tannins contained 12\textendash 48\% tannin and recommended additions had little impact on wine tannin. High tannin additions were readily measured in the wines and were discriminated in sensory analysis with lower intensities of most parameters except brown colour, bitterness and earthy character. Recommended addition rates are too low to impact the measured tannin concentration of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Washington (USA). High enological tannin additions had a measureable impact on final wine had a negative impact on sensory character. Tannins are added to wines for a range of reasons and represent one of many input costs in an industry increasingly seeking efficiencies in response to global economic circumstances, over-supply and an ongoing price point squeeze. This research suggests many tannin additions may be unjustified and have limited or negative impacts on quality.},

  abstract = {Current dietary advice for children is that they should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day (Department of Health. National Diet and Nutrition Survey, 2014). However, many parents report that children are reluctant to eat vegetables and often fail to comply with the five-a-day rule. In fact, in surveys carried out in areas in the UK, the number of children eating according to the five-a-day rule has been found to be as low as 16 \% (Cockroft et al. Public Health Nutr 8(7):861\textendash 69, 2005). This narrative review looks at those factors which contribute to food acceptance, especially fruit and vegetables, and how acceptance might be enhanced to contribute to a wider dietary range in infancy and later childhood. The questions we address are whether the range of foods accepted is determined by the following: innate predispositions interacting with early experience with taste and textures, sensitive periods in infancy for introduction, breastfeeding and the pattern of introduction of complementary foods. Our conclusions are that all of these factors affect dietary range, and that both breastfeeding and the timely introduction of complementary foods predict subsequent food acceptance.},

Moreover, it was determined which sociodemographic and psychological variables predict cooking skills. The data used in the present study are based on the first (2010) and second (2011) surveys of a yearly paper-and-pencil questionnaire (Swiss Food Panel). Data from 4436 participants (47.2\% males) with a mean age of 55.5 years (SD = 14.6, range 21\textendash 99) were available for analysis. The cooking skills scale was validated using a test\textendash retest analysis, confirming that this new scale is a reliable and consistent instrument. Cooking enjoyment was the most important predictor for cooking skills, especially for men. Women had higher cooking skills in all age groups. Cooking skills correlated positively with weekly vegetable consumption, but negatively with weekly convenience food consumption frequency, even while holding the effect of health consciousness related to eating constant. In summary, cooking skills may help people to meet nutrition guidelines in their daily nutrition supply. They allow people to make healthier food choices. It is, therefore, important to teach children and teenagers how to cook and to encourage them to develop their cooking skills.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ethanol concentration on temporal sensory perception of dark rums using temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA). Trained panelists (n = 8) profiled seven commercial aged rums, each at four ethanol concentrations (10, 20, 30, and 40\% alcohol by volume, ABV) in quadruplicate. Fourteen attributes were profiled. During TCATA evaluation, panelists first profiled aroma attributes, then inmouth flavor attributes, and finished with aftertaste attributes for the rums. Results were compared in terms of differences in citation proportion over the course of sample assessment. Higher ethanol concentration resulted in increased citation proportion and duration of basic taste attributes in rums (p {$<$} .05). Flavor attributes including caramel, banana, cherry/almond, cooked apple, and vanilla reached maximum citation proportions at 30\% ABV that were not significantly different from 40\% ABV. These results suggest that ethanol plays a significant role in the temporal sensory perception of aged rums and that ethanol concentrations typically evaluated by trained panels (\textasciitilde 20\% ABV) may inaccurately represent certain aspects of commercial rums from a temporal perspective.},

The aim of the study was twofold: first to explore the relationship between objective measures of meal variety and subjective post-meal ratings of perceived variety, and second to explore the associations between subjective meal variety and decision-making rules and individual eating styles. Data consist of 510 meals compiled from workplace lunch buffets by 71 respondents over 31 optional days. Meals were photographed and coded according to the number of components (dishes served), food groups, colours, size and shape of food on the plates. A mixed model approach was used to analyse data due to the repetitive structure of the data. Results show that subjective variety was marginally associated with the number of food groups, but there was no association with other objective measures, such as the number of components or any of the visual cues of the meal. Subjective meal variety was linked with the decision-making rule of having many dishes when compiling buffet lunches. Participants with higher scores on uncontrolled eating and food neophobia were found to perceive their meals less varied than those with lower scores. Moreover, the rule of having many dishes was positively associated with uncontrolled eating and negatively associated with cognitive restraint. Consumers' perception of within-meal variety seems to be more linked to their idea of how to compose their meal and individual tendencies towards food and eating rather than the objective measures applied. \'O 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study looked at the antecedents of behaviour and examined salient foodrelated values and attitudes. To discover personal meanings and patterns of everyday food choices across different situations we used a qualitative approach in the form of repertory grid interviews. An analysis of the personal constructs elicited from a representative sample of 100 Swiss consumers revealed elaborated value systems. The food-related values can be summarised as: authenticity/naturalness, conviviality, health, quality/indulgence, convenience, and price. The salience of these values and their negatively evaluated counterparts differed for various social eating situations and product categories. Consumers' personal values also differed significantly from their perception of current trends in eating culture. In every-day food choices interdependent food-related values compete and are thus a possible cause of ambivalence and conflicts. The findings offer explanations of discrepancies between values/ attitudes and behaviour that may be due to situational constraints and habits. Implications for companies include the need for strategic realignment to regain consumers' trust by providing comprehensive value-congruent food solutions that also consider health and ethical criteria.},

In a series of six experiments using model systems, commercially available beverages and solid foods, we explored the possibility that asymmetric dominance effects may influence the results of food preference testing. Within a model system (experiments 1\textendash 3), we failed to observe evidence of a bias arising from asymmetric dominance. In contrast, when perceptually complex beverages and foods were used (experiments 4\textendash 6), we found relative preference was altered by the introduction of an additional product into the choice set. Critically, we found this bias was able to induce a significant preference (experiments 4\textendash 5) or make a significant preference disappear (experiment 6). Implications of this potential source of bias are discussed in a context relevant to sensory scientists and product developers.},

  abstract = {Oral chemosensation can vary greatly across individuals, both in terms of the lowest concentration that can be detected (threshold) and in the magnitude of perceived intensity for stimuli at higher concentrations (suprathreshold response). Individuals who experience greater taste intensity are often termed supertasters, and this phenotype has typically been measured via the suprathreshold bitterness of the tastant propylthiouracil (PROP). Notably, supertasting extends beyond bitterness and other tastants to include oral somatosensation and retronasal olfaction, and it may also include finer acuity as well. Here, we describe the evolution of the supertasting concept over the last 20 years, and summarize the current state of the field. Alternative phenotyping approaches that are not dependent on PROP are reviewed, and the molecular genetics of broadly tuned heightened taste and orosensory response are discussed. We conclude by initiating a conversation on nomenclature as we look toward the next 20 years of chemosensory research.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, basic research in chemoreceptor genetics and neurobiology has revolutionized our understanding of individual differences in chemosensation. From an evolutionary perspective, chemosensory variations appear to have arisen in response to different living environments, generally in the avoidance of toxins and to better detect vital food sources. Today, it is often assumed that these differences may drive variable food preferences and choices, with downstream effects on health and wellness. A growing body of evidence indicates chemosensory variation is far more complex than previously believed. However, just because a genetic polymorphism results in altered receptor function in cultured cells or even behavioral phenotypes in the laboratory, this variation may not be sufficient to influence food choice in free living humans. Still, there is ample evidence to indicate allelic variation in TAS2R38 predicts variation in bitterness of synthetic pharmaceuticals (e.g., propylthiouracil) and natural plant compounds (e.g., goitrin), and this variation associates with differential intake of alcohol and vegetables. Further, this is only one of 25 unique bitter taste genes (TAS2Rs) in humans, and emerging evidence suggests other TAS2Rs may also contain polymorphisms that are functional with respect to ingestive behavior. For example, TAS2R16 polymorphisms are linked to the bitterness of naturally occurring plant compounds and alcoholic beverage intake, a TAS2R19 polymorphism associates with differences in quinine bitterness and grapefruit bitterness and liking, and TAS2R31 polymorphisms associate with differential bitterness of plant compounds like aristolochic acid and the sulfonyl amide sweeteners saccharin and acesulfame-K. More critically with respect to food choices, these polymorphisms may vary independently from each other within and across individuals, meaning a monolithic one-size-fits-all approach to bitterness needs to be abandoned. Nor are genetic differences restricted to bitterness. Perceptual variation has also been associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in odors associated with meat defects (boar taint), green/grassy notes, and cilantro, as well as umami and sweet tastes (TAS1R1/2/3). Here, a short primer on receptor genetics is provided, followed by a summary of current knowledge, and implications for human ingestive behavior are discussed.},

The specialty breads (n=10) studied had been evaluated by consumers, and perceived freshness was known. All sensory attributes and 33 mass ions representative of the PTR-MS spectra significantly (p{$<$}0.05) distinguished between the different breads. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to model and predict sensory profiles as a function of volatile composition for all breads. In addition, a separate model that related volatile composition to known consumer freshness of the 10 specialty breads was created. For each model, accuracy was validated by comparing the differences between predicted and actual, sensory and freshness intensities.},

The results showed that time use had a negative influence on perceived convenience and a positive effect on satisfaction with co-production, but did not influence the global evaluation of the product. Satisfaction with co-production and perceived convenience had a positive influence on the global evaluation. Knowledge had a negative influence on time use. Finally, knowledge and perceived convenience had a positive relationship with satisfaction with co-production. In total, seven out of nine hypotheses are supported by the data. The study suggests that time use, perceived convenience, and satisfaction with co-production can be an important variables in the understanding of the evaluative outcome of a co-produced product. The dual role of time use can be positioned as something the consumer wants to minimize for convenient reasons or extended in order to be satisfied with the co-production effort.

Although consumer acceptance and preference testing are now widely applied, it is still a matter of opinion as to how best testing should be done, including what specific methodology should be used. The aim of this study was to compare three consumer acceptance methods (9-point hedonic, labeled affective magnitude and unstructured line scales) and two consumer preference methods (best\textendash worst scaling and preference ranking) in terms of the results they generate and aspects of implementation. This study sought to better understand; how well individual methods discriminate samples, similarities and difference in their patterns of sample discrimination, consumer perception of their implementation, and practicalities. Consumers evaluated six samples in duplicate by acceptance ratings and preference ranking, and 10 triads for best\textendash worst scaling. While all test methods detected a significant difference between samples (p {$<$} 0.05), a larger F-value or improved discrimination, was produced by best\textendash worst scaling compared to acceptance methods. Significant pair-wise sample comparisons were also observed among the methods. Preference maps of individual test methods further illustrated similar sample preferences with regard to sensory properties of products. Comparison of discriminability across methods by generalized procrustes analysis (GPA) found that the patterns of sample discrimination were very similar. Based upon consumer perception, methods were equally easy to use and allowed for accurate information to be given. Regarding practicality, and number of samples that must be tasted, best\textendash worst scaling was the most demanding, followed by preference ranking, and then the acceptance methods. Results indicated that under controlled laboratory testing conditions greater discrimination occurred by best\textendash worst scaling. However, similar conclusions were reached when determining whether consumer acceptance or preference was obtained by the 9-point hedonic scale, labeled affective magnitude, unstructured line scale or preference ranking. Sample size, product type and type of data produced should be taken into account when selecting a test method.},

Literature demonstrates that consumer hedonic ratings elicited in the natural consumption context differ to those elicited under controlled conditions. This suggests that when removing a product from its natural consumption context, accurate hedonic ratings may not be obtained. The interest of this research was to develop an approach that evokes a consumption context in the sensory laboratory and study its impact on hedonic ratings. A written scenario was developed that was effective at making participants imagine an occasion when they desired a refreshing beverage. Consumer hedonic ratings of four apple juice samples elicited using the evoked consumption context (context condition) were compared to those elicited in a control condition (i.e., no evoked context). Differences in mean hedonic ratings of the samples were observed between the two conditions with greater sample discrimination observed for the evoked context condition. Consumers using the evoked context found it easy to indicate their product liking/disliking, and felt that the liking information they provided was accurate, more so than consumers in the control setting. Sensory practitioners need to be aware of the potential use of an evoked context in a control setting for eliciting product hedonic ratings, and understand its impact on mean hedonic ratings.},

In addition to the sensory properties, the context in which a product is consumed can influence how that product is liked. The aim of this paper was to examine the effect of different evoked consumption contexts on consumer hedonic responses. Written scenarios instructed consumers to imagine their own consumption context. The evoked consumption contexts were consumers imagined response to the written scenario. Mean hedonic ratings for four apple and four blackcurrant juices using three evoked consumption contexts and a control context (no evoked consumption context) were compared within and between the four contexts. The three evoked consumption contexts were having a fruit beverage: while eating breakfast, while watching a movie, and while having something refreshing to drink. The written descriptions provided by the consumers established that different occasions were imagined for each of the three evoked consumption contexts. A greater effect of evoked consumption contexts on hedonic response was observed for the blackcurrant juice compared to the apple juice. Lower hedonic ratings for the blackcurrant juices occurred under the evoked contexts compared to the control context. Although differences in the overall level of mean hedonic ratings and liking of individual blackcurrant juice samples were observed in evoked consumption contexts, rank order of the juice samples was similar. From the consumers' perspective, evoking a context in a control setting did not impact on the task demands of hedonic ratings. Findings suggest that hedonic ratings are influenced by the product type and the type of evoked consumption context. This study demonstrated the potential use of evoked contexts in a laboratory setting as an approach to provide consumers with a frame of reference in which products are assessed. Evoking context using a written scenario may serve as a tool to explore product liking under different consumption contexts that may not be feasible to carry out due to practical or financial constraints.},

The attributes generally could be described as dairy-like (buttery, cooked milk, dairy-fat, dairy-sour, dairy-sweet); fatty-acid/animal (animalic, butyric, decaying animal, fresh fish, fish oil, goaty, sweaty, waxy);fungal (moldy, mushroom); other aromatics (fermented fruity/winey, fruity, nutty, pineapple, sauerkraut, smokey, soy sauce); mouthfeelings (astringent, biting, pungent, sharp); and fundamental tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter). All attributes, except fresh fish and smokey, described significant differences among the 42 cheeses. Some of the flavor attributes, including many of the dairy attributes, the fundamental tastes, and sharp and astringent mouthfeelings, were common to all the cheeses tested in this study. Other attributes, such as buttery and butyric acid, were found in most cheeses. Several attributes, for example, cooked milk and sweaty, were specific to only a few cheeses. The factor analysis of the data was unclear, indicating that no one factor solution best described the data. Further study of the factors indicated that groupings of some attributes resulted in substantial loss of cheese description. Therefore, the original attributes probably cannot be reduced substantially in number and still adequately describe natural cheese flavor.},

The limited body of research concerning food safety knowledge and practices among minority consumers has focused more on general food safety knowledge than on culturally specific food handling practices. The purpose of the research reported here was to explore food handling behaviors of minority racial-ethnic consumers through in-depth discussions in focus group settings. In this way, we hoped to identify potential unique, previously unidentified food handling practices among these consumers. Nine focus groups were held in Philadelphia, PA. Three focus groups were conducted with African American consumers, three with Hispanic consumers, and three with Asian consumers. In all, 56 consumers participated. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for unique and potentially unsafe food handling behaviors. Potentially unsafe food handling practices identified among all three groups included extended time to transport food from retail to home and washing of raw poultry. Culturally unique behaviors within groups included (i) using hot water (Asian, Hispanic) or acidic solutions (African American, Hispanic) to clean raw poultry, (ii) purchasing live poultry (Asian, Hispanic), (iii) cooking poultry overnight (African American), and (iv) preparing bite-size pieces of meat prior to cooking (Asian, Hispanic). To have focus groups include a limited number of participants and nonrandom sampling means that these themes and trends cannot be extrapolated to represent food mishandling among these populations in general. Results presented here allow modification of an existing food safety survey to identify the prevalence of these food handling practices among consumers of different demographics.},

Robust design methods distinguish between two types of design variables: control factors and noise factors. The control factors in this study were enological variables used to make the wines. The noise factors were the contexts in which the wines were evaluated. Eight Chardonnay wines were produced according to an experimental design with or without (1) malolactic fermentation, (2) oak contact, and (3) sugar addition to the finished wine. The wines were served in a laboratory and in a reception room with or without food, and rated for degree of liking on the nine-point hedonic scale by 55 wine consumers. Analyses of variance showed that the control factors and the noise factors had significant, and similar in size, effects on liking. The robust design methodology affords the product designer the ability to better understand the effects of product variation and context variation on product acceptability.},

The experimental sample set consisted of six different cheeses selected on the basis of a sensory descriptive test of a total of 15 cheeses performed by a trained panel. A panel of 87 consumers evaluated the cheese samples for overall liking in three different testing conditions, at a laboratory, at a central location and at home. The consumer panel was divided into three groups, each with different order of the testing conditions. The main results showed that changing the environments and the degree of social interaction in the consumer tests had no significant effect on hedonic ratings for the products. Lack of a natural meal context during testing, similar expectations in the three testing situations and high familiarity of the product category may explain the high degree of consistency in hedonic ratings.},

In this paper we address these issues and critically discuss convenience food by using empirical findings from a Danish study that deals with practitioners' uses of meal box schemes. The methodological design consists of thirteen individual interviews, four focus groups and some observations of cooking practices. We combine the empirical findings with a particular definition of convenience food by Brunner et al. (2010) and selected practice theoretical concepts. This particular combination enables us to categorize meal box schemes as a new form of convenience food called convenient food. In addition, results suggest that meal box schemes reduce leftovers from dinner. Meal boxes also influence dinner related activities such as planning ahead in time and grocery shopping, which require less physical and mental effort.},

To test the hypothesis that olfactory hedonic responses are acquired through associative learning with emotion, two experiments were conducted that varied with regard to whether a novel (,\"A\'utarget,\"A\`u odor) was pre-experimentally pleasant or unpleasant and the emotional association was positive or negative. Participants were randomly assigned to an Experimental Group (odor + emotional association) and various Control Groups. Evaluations of the target odor and several common odors that were not explicitly part of the association procedures (anchor odors) were made: prior to the manipulations, postmanipulation, 24 h after the manipulation, and 1 week from the start date. In both experiments, evaluation of the target odor by all participants was comparable at premanipulation and responses to the anchor odors were unaffected by time or experimental condition. However in each experiment, post-emotional manipulation ratings to the target odor were significantly altered in the Experimental Groups and showed that odor perception had changed in accord with the emotional valence of the associated experience. These findings support the hypothesis that olfactory hedonic responses are learned through emotional associations and raise new methodological and theoretical questions for future research.},

The PM found minerality to be positively correlated with acid taste and citrus, fresh, wet stone, and chemical aromas, and negatively correlated to butter, butterscotch, vanilla, and oak aromas. The PM panel minerality was associated with both aroma and taste perception. The DA found minerality to be positively correlated with reduced, chalky, and grassy aromas and bitter taste, and negatively correlated with barrel, caramel, honey, juicy fruit, musty, and cat pee aromas. Wine groupings were similar between the two panels. Minerality was highly associated with malic acid, tartaric acid, and titratable acidity, and moderately associated with free and total sulfur dioxide. Practical ApplicationsThere were similar concepts for minerality between the two types of panels, but there were also differences. This gives us the hope that teasing out the exact concept of minerality in white wines should be possible.},

  abstract = {A new task goal elicits a feeling of pride in individuals with a subjective history of success, and this achievment pride produces anticipatory goal reactions that energize and direct behavior to approach the task goal. By distinguishing between promotion pride and prevention pride, the present paper extends this classic model of achievement motivation. Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) distinguishes between a promotion focus on hopes and accomplishments (gains) and a prevention focus on safety and responsibilities (non-losses). We propose that a subjective history of success with promotion-related eagerness (promotion pride) orients individuals toward using eagerness means to approach a new task goal, whereas a subjective history of success with prevention-related vigilance (prevention pride) orients individuals toward using vigilance means to approach a new task goal. Studies 1{$\pm$}3 tested this proposal by examining the relations between a new measure of participants' subjective histories of promotion success and prevention success (the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ)) and their achievement strategies in different tasks. Study 4 examined the relation between participants' RFQ responses and their reported frequency of feeling eager or vigilant in past task engagements. Study 5 used an experimental priming technique to make participants temporarily experience either a subjective history of promotion success or a subjective history of prevention success. For both chronic and situationally induced achievement pride, these studies found that when approaching task goals individuals with promotion pride use eagerness means whereas individuals with prevention pride use vigilance means.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a five week sensory-based experiential theme course with fish on 11- to 13-year old early-phased adolescents' food literacy and acceptance of fish. Study design was a quasi-experimental intervention. 32 Food Knowledge school classes were recruited from the eastern part of Denmark. Classes were assigned to intervention group (n~=~185), control group 1 (n~=~123), only baseline and follow-up survey, or control group 2 (n~=~75): one oral lecture between baseline and follow-up survey. Mixed methods strategy was applied: baseline and follow-up survey, participant observation, telephone-, and group interviews. Before between study group analysis control groups were pooled. The following key effects of the intervention were observed: knowledge on fish and cooking increased within specific areas, skills related to fish and cooking increased, especially in girls. Furthermore, the social dimension and helping each other were important elements. In the intervention group no positive effects were observed for liking or assessment of fish disgust; however, theme course evaluation showed that 47\% had become curious on tasting other kinds of fish and 38\% stated a higher liking for fish after participation. Furthermore, teachers reported an increase in acceptance of fish in the children as a result of participating. In conclusion food literacy and fish acceptance were increased through participation in a five week sensory-based experiential theme course with fish.},

A sample of 187 New Zealand regular wine consumers participated in a conjoint experiment using the variety New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. The product stimuli were defined by three attributes: (i) presence/absence of region of origin information, (ii) price level, and (iii) presence/absence of a price discount. Purchase intention ratings, which were analysed using multiple regression and non-parametric bootstraps, suggested that the cue pertaining to information about region of origin was more important for consumers high in product involvement and purchase involvement than for consumers with low levels of involvement. There was also some evidence to suggest that consumers who are high in product involvement place less importance on price and, that consumers who are low in purchase involvement place greater importance on price discounts.},

In addition, 222 passengers did the same assessments during an actual flight. Specific meals (A1, B1) were less liked in the laboratory than in the re-created airplane. In general, no differentiation in overall liking occurred per meal type between the two tested variants in the laboratory, whereas these two variants were significantly differentiated in liking in the re-created airplane and the actual airplane. Mean overall liking ratings in the re-created airplane did not significantly differ from the mean overall liking ratings in the actual airplane. The observed JAR ratings did not differ much between the re-created airplane and the actual airplane. In summary, the re-created airplane as a testing location produced more similar test results to the actual airplane than the traditional laboratory. Practical applications Sensory consumer testing in re-created contexts may produce results with a higher external validity than laboratory testing and therefore offer a cost-efficient alternative to extensive sensory consumer testing in real-life contexts.},

The tool, Wordify, uses randomized logistic regression (RLR) to identify the words that best discriminate texts drawn from different pre-classified corpora, such as posts written by men versus women, or texts containing mostly negative versus positive valence. We present illustrative examples to show how the tool can be used for such diverse purposes as (1) uncovering the distinctive vocabularies that consumers use when writing reviews on smartphones versus PCs, (2) discovering how the words used in Tweets differ between presumed supporters and opponents of a controversial ad, and (3) expanding the dictionaries of dictionary-based sentiment-measurement tools. We show empirically that Wordify's RLR algorithm performs better at discriminating vocabularies than support vector machines and chisquare selectors, while offering significant advantages in computing time. A discussion is also provided on the use of Wordify in conjunction with other textanalysis tools, such as probabilistic topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to gain more profound knowledge of the role of language in consumer behavior.},

Despite an increasing number of researchers using MTurk, this system was not designed for carrying out behavioral research. Thus, researchers using MTurk must overcome the inherent limitations of the system when using it for research purposes. This paper provides a roadmap for researchers wanting to use MTurk for distributing surveys or experiments, in light of its limitations as a research tool. Specifically, this paper provides the requisite knowledge to setup MTurk as a distribution portal, identifies pitfalls associated with using MTurk for research, as well as discusses more advanced techniques such as accessing target populations with MTurk's general population. Further, this paper discusses external considerations that may require researchers to alter their surveys or experiments to facilitate use with MTurk.},

The protocol for this ring trial was developed from that used in an earlier ring trial in which each laboratory used its normal procedures for descriptive profiling (Nielsen and Zannoni, 1998). The major element of the revised methodology was the consensus vocabulary. All laboratories were able to differentiate between the cheese varieties using the new vocabulary, hence showing a high degree of agreement between assessors within a laboratory. There was a very high degree of agreement between laboratories on the use of attributes for [`]Texture', with a high degree of agreement for [`]Aroma, Taste' and for [`]Smell'. A Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) of the laboratory means showed that the samples lay in the same underlying sensory space and that the laboratories agreed about the location of the samples in the space. There were some differences in the interpretation of the underlying sensory dimensions consistent with differences in the use of the attributes by the different laboratories.},

Overall, sucrose, salt, peanut flavoring and solid content increased perceptions of nuttiness significantly. Consumers were segmented into 3 clusters based on shared drivers of nuttiness: a cluster associating nuttiness primarily with saltiness (n 5 47), a cluster emphasizing high solid content and peanut flavor (n 5 26), and another cluster emphasizing sweetness (n 5 37). CATA results suggested that rich, tasty and natural were consumer terms highly associated with nuttiness.},

Specifically, an experimental design that varied the eating context across (but not within) choice sets was developed. To approximate actual choice situations as much as possible, a labelled experiment was used and the powerful mixed logit model provided a behaviourally sound approach to data analysis. Evidence is presented of complexity of choice behaviour and of the influence eating occasion context exerted on choice behaviour. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential to use stated choice experimentation to study food choice behaviour and offers suggestions for future research. These include exploration of heterogeneity among consumers with respect to the influence context factors exert, and gaining greater insight to the decision processes underlying choice decisions.},

  abstract = {A degree of inter-individual heterogeneity in perceived situational appropriateness for foods and beverages (F\& B) was predicted to exist, and empirically confirmed in studies with {$>$} 1000 Australian and New Zealand adult consumers (urban dwelling). Two main consumer segments labelled ``adaptive'' and ``conforming'' were identified. The main difference between the segments was in the number of F\&B items considered appropriate for a certain eating occasion, with this number being smaller in the segments that seemed to more strongly conform to common norms about what is appropriate to eat and drink at breakfast-, lunch- and dinner-time. There was a positive relationship between perceived appropriateness and stated product liking in accordance with previous reports, and generally less liked foods/beverages were regarded as less appropriate. However, there was also evidence of non-linearity in this relationship such that some highly liked foods were inappropriate for a focal eating occasion (e.g., cereal/muesli at dinner time). Demographic/socio-economic and psychographic variables were largely unsuccessful in explaining segment differences, and, in particular, generalised trait tendency to conform did not differentiate consumers in ``adaptive'' and ``conforming'' segments. Food neophobia was, in some instances, linked to reduced perceived appropriateness, but generally, consumers with high neophobia (FNS {$>$} 50) responded similarly to the aggregate sample in terms of F\&Bs considered to be high vs. low in appropriateness for eating occasions taking place at breakfast-, lunch- and dinner- time. Future research should extend to other F\&B stimuli relevant to Australia and New Zealand, to different consumer populations and culturally appropriate F\&B stimuli, and also seek to better understand the antecedents of perceived situational appropriateness and how these underpin consumer segments based on appropriateness.},

Seven studies with 137\textendash 293 participants each were conducted, using different product categories. Between-subjects experimental designs were used and allocated consumers to one experimental condition (EC). For RQ1, these were hedonic, hedonic immediately followed by a CATA question, and hedonic immediately followed by a rating of term applicability (``not at all'' to ``extremely''). In RQ2, both ECs involved hedonic ratings followed by a CATA question, but the sensory terms differed. Results showed a significant effect of EC on hedonic ratings in three of five studies for RQ1, suggesting that hedonic bias may or may not occur. For RQ2, the terms of the CATA question influenced hedonic ratings in two of three studies, and a negative hedonic effect was seen when CATA terms drew attention to particular characteristics of individual samples. Collectively, the results suggest that likelihood of bias depends on interactions between product category, samples, and terms.},

The present research was methodological in nature and focused on pre-processing of text data, which generally is the most time-consuming stage of analysis. Using responses to an open-ended question from 4341 consumers, document-term matrices (DTM) were created from varying combinations of n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and combinations hereof), stemming (yes or no) and low-frequency term thresholding (retaining all terms or excluding those used~{$<~$}0.1\%, {$<$}1\% or~{$<~$}5\%). By comparison to a fixed standard \textendash{} manually derived content coded of respondents' answers \textendash{} the relative impact of the three pre-processing steps were assessed. PLS-DA was used to do so, and classifier performance was evaluated using AUC-ROC scores. Inclusion of bigrams and trigrams in DTMs did not influence classification performance and stemming had only a minor impact. Inclusion of all and very rare features ({$<$}0.1\%) improved classification performance. The results were invariant of sample size and replicated in subsets of 2000, 1000 and 500 participants. The results may be specific to the short length of the answers (median words~=~4), although they held in a sub-sample of the 500 longest answers (median words~=~41). Future research should directly test the influence of these pre-processing steps, for example, through topic modelling.},

The specific Chardonnay olfactory space was also tentatively linked to the relative concentrations of 29 volatile compounds, regarded as possible aroma-impact compounds. The question now is whether or not those initial results hold independently of the sample under consideration, that is, whether these sensory and chemical spaces are vintage-specific. A series of investigations was conducted on a new set of 46 wines (23 Chardonnay wines and 23 non Chardonnay wines) using the same sensory (wine typicality level) and physico-chemical (Gas Chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry\textendash selected ion monitoring: GC\textendash MS\textendash SIM) approaches as in the earlier study. The sensory space of Chardonnay wines has been identified again in this new study. Compared with white wines of other grape varieties, Chardonnay wines do have distinctive and recognizable olfactory characteristics. LSD tests carried out on the chemical data and a PLS analysis predicting wine typicality level from the chemical data showed that the relative concentrations of 35 volatile compounds affected the wines' typicality scores. Of the 35 compounds, 18 were already among the 29 possible aroma-impact compounds identified by the earlier study. These 18 common volatile compounds seem to be vintage-independent and as such might represent the core of the Chardonnay wine olfactory space. The others seem to be specific to the new wines tested and may contribute to the fuzziness of the boundaries of the Chardonnay wine olfactory space. These results emphasize the complexity of the odor quality of Chardonnay wines, with some volatile compounds remaining stable across vintages, while others are specific to enological practices and to vintages.},

In the next part, sensory knowledge is discussed as tacit knowledge, taking into account the problem of its verbalisation and the nature of its acquisition. The last part explores the social construction of sensory knowledge and its relation to subjective experiences, referring to the concepts of intersubjectivity, objectification and legitimisation.},

  abstract = {Alcoholic cider is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in the US, with consumption increasing many fold in the last decade. This study investigates the cultural differences in characterization of craft and commercial hard ciders between American and Chinese consumers. Two untrained panels assessed their perception of hard cider samples (two commercial, five craft hard ciders, one additional blind duplicate craft cider) through free multiple sorting (FMS), and flash profiling (FP). A multiple factor analysis for FMS and General Procrustes Analysis for FP showed that the sensory maps produced by the groups showed some similarity, however more variability was evident in the Chinese group. Critically, the American group employed more nuanced descriptors for aroma and flavor (e.g. nutty, onion, oxidized, robustness, yeasty) and describing complex mouthfeel attributes (e.g. carbonation, viscosity, and roughening). American panelists also used 40\% more terms than Chinese panelists, who used mostly basic flavors, tastes, hedonic terms, and comparisons to describe varying sensory experiences. A lack of exposure to hard ciders in the Chinese group, combined with linguistic differences, and a lack of standardized lexicon for ciders could contribute to less discriminability perceived between products. Our results highlight the importance of considering cultural and language differences, along with familiarity with the product category of interest in comparative cross-cultural work. Understanding these cultural differences to conduct cross-cultural sensory research may be of great importance to cider makers as the industry moves towards developing a standardized vocabulary for hard cider evaluation.},

As non-traditional and individualized eating patterns have become more common, new ways of thinking about routine eating practices are needed. This study sought to gain conceptual understanding of working adults' eating routines. Forty-two purposively sampled US adults reported food intake and contextual details about eating episodes in qualitative 24-h dietary recalls conducted over 7 consecutive days. Using the constant comparative method, researchers analyzed interview transcripts for recurrent ways of eating that were either explicitly reported by study participants as ``routines'' or emergent in the data. Participants' eating routines included repetition in food consumption as well as eating context, and also involved sequences of eating episodes. Eating routines were embedded in daily schedules for work, family, and recreation. Participants maintained purposeful routines that helped balance tension between demands and values, but they modified routines as circumstances changed. Participants monitored and reflected upon their eating practices and tended to assess their practices in light of their personal identities. These findings provide conceptual insights for food choice researchers and present a perspective from which practitioners who work with individuals seeking to adopt healthful eating practices might usefully approach their tasks.},

  abstract = {The research presented validates the hypothesis that Mouth Behavior drives food texture choice and preferences. During qualitative research, when given a wide array of food products to choose from, there were clear texture differences between Mouth Behavior groups in the food items that were chosen as ``love'' or ``not worth buying''. The textures chosen as ``loved'' were those whose texture most matched their Mouth Behavior (could be easily eaten with their desired Mouth Behavior); while those foods that were rejected had textures that did not allow them to be easily eaten with their primary Mouth Behavior. These differences were then validated quantitatively, where food texture preference were shown to significantly differ by Mouth Behavior group, not only in overall texture, but also in hardness and eating time. Additionally, in previous qualitative research, study participants were found to perceive the texture of the same foods differently. Individuals tried to manipulate the product into a texture that could be eaten as desired, and therefore the texture of a given food was perceived differently by each group. This research also demonstrates that texture is not static, and that texture changes over the eating experience. The way the texture changes is of primary importance in determining food product acceptance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the variety and volume of data acquired by modern analytical instruments in order to conduct a better authentication of food has dramatically increased. Several pattern recognition tools have been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of available trial data. The most widely used methods are principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). Nevertheless, there are alternative data treatment methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF), that show a great potential and more advantages compared to conventional ones. In this paper, we explain the background of these methods and review and discuss the reported studies in which these three methods have been applied in the area of food quality and authenticity. In addition, we clarify the technical terminology used in this particular area of research.},

This study investigates how side dishes (vegetables/starches) affect the hedonic ratings of the main food item (meat/meat substitute) when a plate of these foods is viewed and also after the meal is eaten. The main question is whether the hedonic rating of the main food item assimilates toward the hedonic rating of the side dishes or shows contrast, moving away from the hedonic rating of the side dishes. In Experiment 1, when subjects only viewed a picture of a meal consisting of an imitation chicken tender (main food item) with either hedonically positive or hedonically negative side dishes, no effect of the side dishes was seen on the hedonic rating of the main food item. In Experiment 2, when subjects ate the meal shown in the picture in Experiment 1, hedonic contrast was found. That is, the main food item was rated as less good when simultaneously presented with more hedonically positive side dishes than when presented with hedonically negative side dishes. Thus, when a meal is eaten, foods influence the evaluation of other foods on the same plate. The same is not true when foods are presented in a picture.},

This study had an objective of exploring whether wine experts would group Shiraz wines from the same region together, following ortho and retro nasal assessments of the wines. A cohort of wine experts and a trained descriptive analysis (DA) panel undertook sensory analysis of 29 Shiraz wines sourced from 10 delimited Australian wine producing regions, plus a multi-regional blended Australian Shiraz and a Northern Rhone Syrah. The expert panel undertook sorting tasks based on their ortho and retro nasal assessment of the wines. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the resultant data provided a three dimensional solution that included many attributes commonly associated with Australian Shiraz. Cluster analysis of the MDS and DA data revealed that at least two wines from Canberra, Langhorne Creek, Coonawarra, McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley and Great Western were grouped together. Although wines from the same region may have shared similar sensory attributes, the more diverse the region in terms of geography and meso-climate, the more difficult it was to determine those common sensory attributes. This is the first study to attempt to define the sensory attributes of a number of delimited Australian Shiraz producing regions. The data suggested that there were some sensory similarities between wines from the same region but other factors impact the sensory profile, so to determine regional Shiraz characters more extensive research using these techniques and wines made under controlled conditions would be required.

In this study sixteen commercial bitters were analyzed using volatile (GC\textendash MS) and sensory profiling and multivariate statistics including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS). The samples differed significantly in their citrus, celery, and spice characteristics. 148 volatile compounds were tentatively identified and the composition varied significantly with the type of bitters sample evaluated. PLS analysis showed that the volatile data correlated well overall to the sensory data, explaining 60\% of the overall variability in the dataset. Primary aldehydes and phenylpropanoids were most closely related to green and spice-related sensory descriptors. However, the sensory impact of terpenoid compounds was difficult to predict in many cases. This may be due to the wide range of aroma qualities associated with terpenes as well as to concentration, synergistic or masking effects.},

Asymptotic tests do exist but fail in many situations, hence the interest in permutation tests. However, the main drawbacks of the permutation tests are that they are time consuming. It is therefore interesting to approximate the permutation distribution with continuous distributions (without doing any permutation). The current approximations (normal approximation, a log-transformation and Pearson type III approximation) are discussed and a new one is described: an Edgeworth expansion. Finally, these different approximations are compared for both simulations and for a sensory example.},

Then, two ways to visualize the uncertainty due to missing values onto the principal component analysis results are described. The first one consists in projecting the imputed data sets onto a reference configuration as supplementary elements to assess the stability of the individuals (respectively of the variables). The second one consists in performing a principal component analysis on each imputed data set and fitting each obtained configuration onto the reference one with Procrustes rotation. The latter strategy allows to assess the variability of the principal component analysis parameters induced by the missing values. The methodology is then evaluated from a real data set.},

Negative reviews, especially in expensive restaurants, were more likely to use features previously associated with narratives of trauma: negative emotional vocabulary, a focus on the past actions of third person actors such as waiters, and increased use of references to ``we'' and ``us'', suggesting that negative reviews function as a means of coping with service\textendash related trauma. Positive reviews also employed framings contextualized by expense: inexpensive restaurant reviews use the language of addiction to frame the reviewer as craving fatty or starchy foods. Positive reviews of expensive restaurants were long narratives using long words emphasizing the reviewer's linguistic capital and also focusing on sensory pleasure. Our results demonstrate that portraying the self, whether as well\textendash educated, as a victim, or even as addicted to chocolate, is a key function of reviews and suggests the important role of online reviews in exploring social psychological variables.},

Observational studies of the family meal have been employed with increasing frequency, yet there is currently no tool available for measuring the healthfulness of food served during the meal. Here we present the development and validation of the Healthy Meal Index (HMI), a novel tool for scoring the healthfulness of foods served to children during a meal, as well as sociodemographic predictors of meal scores. Parents of 233 children, aged 4e8 years, self-recorded three home dinners. A research assistant obtained a list of foods available during the meal (meal report) via phone call on the night of each videorecorded meal. This meal report was coded into component food groups. Subsequently, meals were scored based on the availability of more healthy ``Adequacy foods'' and the absence of ``Moderation foods'', (of which reduced consumption is recommended, according to pediatric dietary guidelines). Adjusted linear regression tested the association of sociodemographic characteristics with HMI scores. A validation study was conducted in a separate sample of 133 children with detailed meal data. In adjusted models, female children had higher HMI Moderation scores (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02), but did not differ in HMI Adequacy or Total scores. Parents with more education served meals with higher HMI Adequacy (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) and Total scores (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001), though no significant difference was seen in HMI Moderation score (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.21).

  abstract = {Abstract                            Wines are usually evaluated by wine experts and enthusiasts who give numeric ratings as well as text reviews. While most wine classification studies have been based on conventional statistical models using numeric variables, there has been very limited work on implementing neural network models using wine reviews. In this paper, we apply neural network models (CNN, BiLSTM, and BERT) to extract useful information from wine reviews and classify wines according to different rating classes. Using a large collection of wine reviews from               Wine Spectator               , the study shows that BERT, a neural network framework recently developed by Google, has the best performance. In the two-class classification (90\textendash 100 and 80\textendash 89), BERT achieves an accuracy of 89.12\%, followed by BiLSTM (88.69\%) and CNN (88.02\%). In the four-class classification (95\textendash 100, 90\textendash 94, 85\textendash 89, and 80\textendash 84), BERT yields an 81.57\% accuracy, while the other two produce an 80\% accuracy. The neural network models in the paper are independent of domain knowledge and thus can be easily extended to other kinds of text analysis. Expanding the limited work on wine text review classification studies, these models are up-to-date and provide valuable additions to wine data analysis. (JEL Classifications: C45, C88, D83)},

Subjects selected three factors, from a list of 15, which they believed had the greatest influence on their food choice.SettingThe interviews for the survey were conducted in subjects' homes.Results`Quality/freshness of food' was the most frequently selected food choice factor (51\%) followed by 'taste` (43\%) and `trying to eat a healthy diet' (36\%). Female gender, increasing age and higher levels of education were found to be independent sociodemographic factors affecting the selection of `trying to eat a healthy diet' as an important factor in food choice.ConclusionsAlthough included in the top five most frequently selected factors affecting food choice, nutrition/healthy eating does not appear to have top priority for the majority of Irish adults. There are differences between the various sociodemographic groups within the population; males and younger subjects appear to require specific nutrition promotion messages.},

To support the practical adoption of this theory, this paper reports and reflects upon a methodological application of Social Practice Theory which was used to investigate the domestic kitchen-based practices of older adults (aged 60+) in order to understand the role of food safety within the everyday performance of these. Social Practice Theory requires a research design that situates data generation techniques into the `space' in which the practices are performed and gives equal investigative consideration to the physical and social spheres of practices. We demonstrate that these methodological principles necessitate the use of mixed methods, and this case study presents a `tool-kit' of data generation techniques that produced visual, verbal, textual, technical and scientific data. Through the presentation of results at the level of the individual household, the case study demonstrates how the different data streams acted as analytical lenses which facilitated data corroboration and comparison, and provided the basis for a grounded conceptual elaboration of domestically situated food provisioning and handling practices and the role of food safety within these.},

Assessments of flavour, texture and overall liking of corn-fed chicken were made across three different testing conditions (laboratory-based under normal lighting; laboratory-based under controlled lighting; and, home testing). Least favourable evaluations occurred under laboratory-based conditions irrespective of what lighting was used. Consumers perceived the product more favourably in terms of flavour ( p , 0.001), texture ( p , 0.001) and overall preference ( p , 0.001) when evaluated in the familiar setting of the home. Home testing produced more consistent assessments than under either of the two laboratory-based test conditions. The results imply that home evaluation should be undertaken routinely in new food product development.},

Both approaches have shown advantages in adopting consumption context in consumer tests. However, it has not been investigated whether either one of the approaches may be more effective or whether using these approaches together would be more advantageous than using each solely in terms of bring in consumption context. The aims were to understand the effects of evocation in different environmental settings on consumers liking and to explore the differences of these effects based on consumer involvement levels. Consumers participated in one of the 4 contextual conditions of 2 \^A 2 factorial design, consisting of `evocation' factor (with vs. without evocation instruction) and `environment' factor (booth vs. simulated caf\'e), respectively. Consumers evaluated liking for two coffee samples and responded to a coffee involvement questionnaire. The results showed that both factors have influenced on consumer liking. These effects were different according to coffee types differing in hedonic levels. Vividness of evocation lasted longer in the simulated caf\'e setting, implying physical cues reinforcing cognitive evocation. When consumers were classified according to involvement scores, liking score of the high involvement group was little affected by either situational factors, while low involvement group was highly affected by the `environment' factor. The findings of the study provide important perspectives to be considered for researches into ``situational'' tests, including which situational approach to apply as well as consumer involvement.},

Twenty-seven wine and food professionals rated the wine and cheese pairs using a bipolar structured line scale (12 cm). The ``ideal pair,'' scored at the midpoint of the scale, was defined as a wine and cheese combination where neither the wine nor the cheese dominated. For each cheese, mean deviation-from-ideal scores were determined and evaluated by analysis of variance. Scores closest to six were considered ``ideal,'' while higher or lower scores represented pairs where the ``wine'' or the ``cheese'' dominated, respectively. In general, white wines had mean scores closer to six (``ideal'') than either the red or specialty wines. The late harvest, ice and port-type wines were more difficult to pair. Judges varied considerably in their individual assessments reflecting a high degree of personal expectation and preference.},

  abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such `multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize `traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

  abstract = {The acceptability of cheese depends largely on the flavor formed during ripening. The flavor profiles of cheeses are complex and region-or manufacturer-specific which have made it challenging to understand the chemistry of flavor development and its correlation with sensory properties. Infrared spectroscopy is an attractive technology for the rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput analysis of foods, providing information related to its composition and conformation of food components from the spectra. Our objectives were to establish infrared spectral profiles to discriminate Swiss cheeses produced by different manufacturers in the United States and to develop predictive models for determination of sensory attributes based on infrared spectra. Fifteen samples from 3 Swiss cheese manufacturers were received and analyzed using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The spectra were analyzed using soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) to build a classification model. The cheeses were profiled by a trained sensory panel using descriptive sensory analysis. The relationship between the descriptive sensory scores and ATR-IR spectra was assessed using partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis. SIMCA discriminated the Swiss cheeses based on manufacturer and production region. PLSR analysis generated prediction models with correlation coefficients of validation (rVal) between 0.69 and 0.96 with standard error of cross-validation (SECV) ranging from 0.04 to 0.29. Implementation of rapid infrared analysis by the Swiss cheese industry would help to streamline quality assurance.},

The quality (i.e. the appearance of the leaves, and the color and flavor of the infusion) of 69 samples was evaluated by expert graders, and samples were grouped into four quality grades. Using descriptive analysis sensory profiles of the rooibos samples were developed and 121 aroma, flavor, taste, and mouthfeel descriptors were generated. A rooibos sensory wheel was created by selecting 27 flavor, taste and mouthfeel attributes and grouping these terms together to form a logical, convenient and user-friendly overview of the sensory descriptors associated with rooibos. The most frequently occurring descriptors were selected to compile a rooibos sensory lexicon of 14 flavor, taste and mouthfeel attributes along with a definition and reference standard for each term. It was found that the term ``characteristic'' rooibos flavor may be described as a combination of honey, woody and herbal-floral notes with a slightly sweet taste and subtle astringency. Also, differences in the sensory characteristics between and within different quality grades were established with low-quality tea often being associated with green, hay-like and musty flavors and a bitter or sour taste. High-quality tea was generally associated with pleasant rooibos attributes including honey, woody, floral and caramel notes and a sweet taste. This research is a first step towards the broader objective of standardizing the sensory terminology of rooibos tea.},

While several studies have investigated the importance of wine expertise in the ability to perform odor-related sensory tasks, little attention has been paid to the influence of expertise on the semantic categorization of wine odors. To bridge this gap, this study aimed to explore the influence of a subject's expertise on the semantic representation of wine odors by means of a free sorting task. For this purpose, 156 subjects were recruited. Their level of expertise was measured using a questionnaire and the data analysis revealed four clusters of subjects with a gradual level of expertise. Subjects also performed a sorting task on 96 odor terms. From the number and the size of odor groups formed, as well as the additive tree representation and the consensus partition between the terms for each expertise level, we observed that all subjects, regardless of their experience, had largely the same semantic categorization of wine-odor attributes, which was mainly shaped by the sources of the odorants. It appeared that level of wine expertise played a minor role in creating the semantic representation of wine odors, affecting mainly the knowledge of specialized terms.},

Specifically, an algorithm that splits a tree into successive subtrees was developed, based on a ratio of the lengths of edges. The stability of the clusters obtained with this technique was then evaluated using measurements of cohesion and isolation that were generated using a bootstrapping strategy. Finally, the degree of association of each object to clusters was analyzed to gain insight into their internal structure. This analysis was performed on the results of a sorting task conducted by 156 subjects, who were asked to sort 96 terms associated with the odor of wine. The methodology developed in this paper represents an innovative way to highlight groups of terms within a large set of wine odor attributes, with the ultimate goal being to improve the structure of the lexicon.},

Samples with reduced carbonyl concentrations had significantly lower perceived trigeminal burn intensity. Sensory recombination experiments revealed that addition of carbonyl compounds increased trigeminal burn perception in model systems; confirming the direct relationship between the concentration of carbonyl compounds and trigeminal burn. The strongest potentiators of the trigeminal response were carbonyl compounds octanal, nonanal, benzaldehyde and 2-heptanone suggesting the probability that carbonyl species such as saturated aldehydes and ketones act as agonists to activate nociceptors such as TRPV1 and TRPA1 and elicit trigeminal burn.},

The flavor of 152 cheeses from Estonia, France, Italy, Germany, Holland, Austria, England, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, and Denmark were described during 4 independent studies. The sensory data from these studies were combined. The cheeses were sorted according to milk type and texture, and flavor characteristics of these groups were described. The main flavor characteristics of the cheeses tested were salty, sweet, sour, astringent, biting, pungent, sharp, nutty, musty/earthy, dairy fat, buttery, and dairy sweet. The cluster analysis divided the cheeses into 4 clusters: clusters 1 and 2 were sour, dairy sour, salty, astringent, biting, and varied in buttery (cluster 1) and sharp notes (cluster 2). Cluster 1 and 2 were mainly composed of French cheeses, while clusters 3 and 4 represented cheeses from various countries. Cluster 3 and 4 were sweet, with cooked milk and nutty characteristics and varied from buttery (cluster 3) to sharp notes (cluster 4). Cheeses from some countries, for example, France and Estonia, generally exhibited common sensory characteristics within the specific country, but cheeses from some other countries, such as Italy, varied widely, and seemed to have no common sensory theme. Most regional cheese standards are not specific about flavor profiles and these results suggest it may be possible to start a further characterization of cheeses in some countries.},

Rather than treating these kinds of disparity as the result of data being selfcontradictory, this paper, which builds on sociological theories and an empirical study, suggests that the concept of context can contribute to a better understanding of the threatened paradoxes. First, the paper introduces and discusses context as a theoretical and methodological approach in studies of public perceptions of food quality. Second, a case study of the importance of different contexts for Danish public perceptions of meat quality is reported. The study involved a series of focus-group interviews with Danes. Its results demonstrate that public concerns about meat quality vary, depending on whether they relate to meat in an everyday context or production context. It is concluded that the deployment of context as a methodological and interpretive frame improves our understanding of disparities in the reporting of public perceptions of food qualities.},

This article seeks to deepen our understanding of the concerns that may underlie negative attitudes to various kinds of risk reduction strategy in meat production, with the aim of distinguishing between forms of risk reduction in terms of their acceptability. The paper reports the result of a focus-group study. Six focus groups with Danish citizens (N: 5\textendash 9) were conducted during May 2006. The design of the groups took a bottom-up approach and included elements of meat quality, meat safety and risk reduction strategies. The study shows the dilemma risk reduction presents to members of the public. On the one hand, people want safe meat; on the other, the study showed that with the exception of hygiene practices, people generally have an aversion to risk reduction strategies. Some variation was found, however, in the rejection of the strategies. Thus, more acceptable strategies are characterised by a low degree of technological interference, and by being close to the consumer's experience in everyday life and/or familiar to the participants' picture of meat production. It is also important that the strategy does not alter the quality of the end-product (meat) in an unfavourable way. The implications of the results and the inherent dilemma for meat safety policy formation are discussed.},

This approach assumes that a same word mentioned by different panelists corresponds to a similar perception, which is not always verified. To solve this problem, we propose a new methodology based on multiple factor analysis for contingency tables. This methodology offers a mean configuration of the products taking into account all the individual words but spots these that are consensual to ease the interpretation. The consensual words have the same meaning for most of the consumers as far as they describe the same products. A test, based on resampling techniques, allows for assessing the significance of the consensus. A real example shows how this methodology eases the interpretation of the word-count based methods by solving problems arising from the large diversity of vocabulary and the different meanings possibly associated to a same word.},

In this fMRI investigation we report a significant correlation between the activation of a region of the human orbitofrontal cortex and the decrease in subjective pleasantness when a liquid food is eaten to satiety. Moreover, a cluster of voxels in the orbitofrontal cortex showed a decrease in its activation that was specific to the particular liquid food consumed in a meal, providing a neural correlate of sensory-specific satiety to a liquid whole food in humans. This sensory-specific reduction in activation of the orbitofrontal cortex correlating with subjective pleasantness is consistent with an important role for the orbitofrontal cortex in human emotion and motivation, and associated subjective states.},

  abstract = {Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods are particularly suited to the analysis of relationships between measures of brain activity and of behavior or experimental design. In neuroimaging, PLS refers to two related methods: (1) symmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC), and (2) asymmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). The most popular (by far) version of PLS for neuroimaging is PLSC. It exists in several varieties based on the type of data that are related to brain activity: behavior PLSC analyzes the relationship between brain activity and behavioral data, task PLSC analyzes how brain activity relates to predefined categories or experimental design, seed PLSC analyzes the pattern of connectivity between brain regions, and multi-block or multi-table PLSC integrates one or more of these varieties in a common analysis. PLSR, in contrast to PLSC, is a predictive technique which, typically, predicts behavior (or design) from brain activity. For both PLS methods, statistical inferences are implemented using cross-validation techniques to identify significant patterns of voxel activation. This paper presents both PLS methods and illustrates them with small numerical examples and typical applications in neuroimaging.},

The challenge lies in the fact that ecologically embedded edibles, grown and made through primarily ecological rather than industrial processes, and using artisan, traditional, and quality practices, show variable and uncertain characteristics. The characteristics, or qualities, of ecologically embedded edibles vary both geographically and in time, challenging the creation of stable market networks. How can ecologically embedded wines be sold when there is no certainty about their qualities? In this article I propose that certainty around qualities is not as crucial an element of transactions as some authors suggest, and I draw on the case study of ecologically embedded wines to extract wider lessons of relevance to marketization of foods and drinks in alternative food networks. I suggest that an understanding of taste not as a fixed and unchangeable quality of people and things, but as a relational and reflexive activity between eaters and edibles, can offer a way of valuing uncertainty around product characteristics. Through a cultivation of a ``taste for uncertainty'' consumers' bodies can become enrolled in supporting artisan, quality, and traditional production through their taste buds. Some pitfalls and limitations of this approach are considered in the conclusion.},

A descriptive analysis panel (n = 8) evaluated four Australian Shiraz wines along with four complex food samples, yielding 16 wine and food combinations. Based on the sensory profiles, distinct food and wine pairings (n = 6) were selected for consumer preference tests, comprising a real life, pseudo-three course meal with two wines. According to American consumers (n = 108), in the most appropriate pairings, flavour intensities increased and wine taste attributes changed in relation to individual components. Appropriate pairings positively correlated with liking, sensory complexity, and expected price to pay, and negatively with balance as a slight wine dominance was preferred. Pairings had an increase in liking and sensory complexity over the individual wine but not the food component. To account for individual variability, consumers were segmented by their liking of the pairing. Key drivers of successful pairings across consumer clusters were similar to the average consumer results, however, the preferred pairings differed by cluster. The findings suggest, the quality of food and wine pairings might be better measured with a combination of direct (dominance/balance, appropriateness of pairing) and indirect methods (sensory complexity, liking), instead of a single scale, and consumer segmentation may better account for the variability of results. The outcome of this study enhanced the understanding of the relationship between consumer behaviour and food and wine pairings.},

The spirit samples were analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry olfactometry and descriptive sensory analysis. Forty-two volatiles were detected with eight deemed as very influential and fifteen deemed as influential to the aroma of new make spirit. Sensory attributes were influenced by barley variety, environment, and the interactions thereof over both seasons, with environment and the interaction of variety x environment having a greater impact than variety alone. Chemometric analysis of the olfactometry and sensory data found that both environment and season had a greater impact on the aromatic sensory perception of the new make spirits than variety alone. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrates a ``terroir'' impact on the flavour of new make spirit and highlights its potential importance especially in relation to single malt whisk(e)y.},

The current study attempts to delineate the effects of meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), gender, and age on psychologically defined food properties in three conceptual dimensions, namely, desired-tobe-eaten, ought-to-be-eaten, and actually-consumed foods, based on self-reporting among 100 Japanese participants. Results showed that there were large discrepancies between food choice motives (composed of desired- and ought-food dimensions) and actually-consumed foods. Accordingly, the effects of meal on food properties were examined in each dimension respectively, and meal effects were supported in all dimensions. Although food choice motives did not differ across age groups, people in their 40's rated the properties of the foods they actually consumed substantially lower than did other age groups. No gender effect was observed. There were higher correlations between desired- and ought-dimensions across meals compared with between desired- and actual- and between ought- and actual-dimensions. In addition, association between dimensions was stronger at dinner compared with breakfast.},

Consumer analysis (i.e., 129 Northern Californian consumers) was also used to evaluate a selection of these NABs (i.e., 12) and how similar they thought the aroma, taste and mouthfeels of these products were to beer, soda, and water. The results show that certain constituents drive the aroma and taste profiles which are responsible for invoking beer perception for these North American consumers. Further, beer likeness might not be a driver of preference in this diverse beverage class for Northern Californian consumers. These are important insights for brewers planning to create products for similar markets and/or more broadly for companies interested in designing other functional/alternative food and beverage products.},

  abstract = {Food neophobia and picky/fussy eating behavior are presented as the two main forms of children's food rejections which are responsible for a reduction of their dietary repertoire. We review the key factors, presented in the literature, that are involved in food rejections during childhood. We first consider a range of ``cognitive factors'', such as food perception, mental representations, categorization of food items, and emotions and feelings toward food. Next we focus on ``social and environmental factors'', as these might also significantly influence and modulate children's food rejections. We then summarize the findings to provide a comprehensive view of the factors involved in children's food rejections. Finally, we discuss the need for future studies on food rejections, regarding (i) the distinction between food neophobia and picky/fussy eating, and (ii) the potential link between food categorization abilities and children's food neophobia and pickiness.},

Additionally, an online questionnaire (Spanish population, n = 362) studied changes in food shopping habits during the lockdown, motivations behind the changes, and perceived reliability of the information received from media. Results showed initial trending searches and most watched YouTube videos were about understanding what COVID-19 is and how the illness can progress and spread. When the official statement of a pandemic was released, trending searches in relation to food and shopping increased. Data retrieved from Twitter also showed an evolution from shopping concerns to the feeling of uncertainty for the oncoming crisis. The answers to the online questionnaire showed reduction of shopping frequency but no changes in shopping location. Products purchased with higher frequency were pasta and vegetables (health motivations), others were purchased to improve their mood (nuts, cheese, and chocolates). Reduced purchasing was attributed to products with a short shelf-life (fish, seafood) or because they were unhealthy and contributed to gained body weight (sugary bakery goods) or mood (desserts). Statements made by experts or scientists were considered by consumers to be the most reliable.},

  abstract = {This research is concerned with explaining consumer preference for Vermont artisan cheese and the relationship between that preference and sensory experience. Artisan cheesemaking is increasingly an important part of Vermont's dairy sector, and this tracks a growing trend of artisan agricultural practice in the United States. In popular discourse and academic research into products like artisan cheese, consumers explain their preferences in terms of intrinsic sensory and extrinsic \textendash{} supposedly nonsensory \textendash food qualities. In laboratory sensory studies, however, the relationship between preference, intrinsic, and extrinsic qualities changes or disappears. In contrast, this study explains this relationship by adopting a social theory of sensory perception as a practice in everyday life. This theory is applied to a series of focus group interviews with Vermont artisan cheese consumers about their everyday perceptions. Based on the data, a conceptual framework for the sensory perception of Vermont artisan cheese is suggested: consumers combine information about producer practice, social context, and the materiality of the product through an active, learned practice of sensory perception. Particular qualities that drive consumer sensory experience and preference are identified from the interview data. Many of these qualities are difficult to categorize as entirely intrinsic or extrinsic, highlighting the need for developing new approaches of sensory evaluation in order to fully capture everyday consumer sensory perception. Thus, this research demonstrates that social theory provides new and valuable insights into consumer sensory preference for Vermont artisan cheese.},

Four representative Vermont cheeses (unripened goat's cheese, bloomy-rind, cheddar, and blue) were presented to 182 different consumers in 2 different information conditions: socially and contextually relevant production information (informed) or generic information about the cheese category from dairy science manuals (blind). Consumers reported their liking using a hedonic line scale and, subsequently, provided free-text comments describing what they liked or disliked about the cheeses. Consumers also reported their familiarity with each cheese and completed the food involvement scale (FIS). Hedonic liking was modeled as a function of cheese type, information condition, familiarity, and FIS score using linear mixed-effect modeling; positive and negative consumer comments were tabulated using textual analysis and descriptive maps were generated using correspondence analysis (CA). The linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that consumer liking was significantly affected by cheese type, information, familiarity, and the consumer's FIS score. Analysis of consumer comments by CA produced empirically sensible, consumer-derived sensory profiles of each cheese; in addition, stable and significant sensory differences were found between sensory descriptions in the informed and blind conditions. Thus, this research demonstrates that information and extrinsic consumer attributes are important for understanding both consumer liking and consumer sensory perception. In addition, textual analysis by CA of free-text consumer comments is presented as an expeditious method for producing sensory profiles, and the advantages of this method are discussed.},

In particular, does the hedonic value of an appetizer affect the hedonic value of the subsequently eaten main course? Hedonic contrast is known to occur in laboratory settings, but so far it has not been demonstrated in ecologically valid, real-world meal situations. To that end, this study was conducted in an ecologically valid setting \textendash{} a training restaurant in a culinary school. Two groups of subjects (Ns = 35 and 29) were served the same pasta main course after either a good or mediocre bruschetta appetizer. The pasta was rated worse (and hedonically negative, M = -9.4) by subjects eating the good appetizer than by subjects eating the mediocre one (who judged it as hedonically positive, M = 17.4). This suggests that the hedonic value of an appetizer can influence the degree to which a diner likes the main course of a meal. Implications for the phenomenon of hedonic contrast and for meal services in restaurant settings are discussed.},

  abstract = {In consumer food-sensory studies, sorting and closely related methods (for example, projective mapping) have often been applied to large product sets which are complex and fatiguing for panelists. Analysis of sorting by Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is common, but this method discards relevant individual decisions; analysis by DISTATIS, which accounts for individual differences, is gaining acceptance. This research posits that replication can improve DISTATIS analysis by stabilizing consumer sensory maps, which are often extremely unstable. As a case study a fatiguing product set was sorted: 10 American whiskeys\textemdash 5 bourbons and 5 ryes\textemdash were sorted into groups by 21 consumers over 2 replications. These products were chosen because American whiskeys are some of the most important distilled beverages in today's market; in particular, ``bourbon'' (mashbill more than 50\% corn) and ``rye'' (more than 50\% rye) whiskeys are important and assumed to be products with distinct sensory attributes. However, there is almost no scientific information about their sensory properties. Data were analyzed using standard and aggregated DISTATIS and MDS. No significant relationship between mashbill and consumer categorization in whiskeys was found; instead, there was evidence of producer and aging effects. aggregated DISTATIS was found to provide more stable results than without replication, and DISTATIS results provided a number of benefits over MDS, including bootstrapped confidence intervals for product separation. In addition, this is the first published evidence that mashbill does not determine sensory properties of American whiskey: bourbons and ryes, while legally distinct, were not separated by consumers.},

  abstract = {Researchers studying consumer food-behaviors, like cooking, in everyday life require better tools for assessment of food-related abilities. This study presents a measurement tool for assessing cooking and food-preparation practices: the Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAFPAS). The CAFPAS is based on the ``Food Agency'' framework for understanding cooking behavior as sociological ``agency'' that emerges from the interaction individual abilities and skills and social structure (see Trubek, Carabello, Morgan, \& Lahne, 2017; Wolfson et al., 2017). Thus, the scale seeks to measure the degree to which individuals are able to set and achieve cooking and provisioning goals. Potential scale items were generated and screened by experts (N = 7). The resulting 70 items, with demographic and validation items, were administered to a development sample of US adults through email listservs (N = 445) and administered to an independent validation sample of US adults through Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 498) and both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to evaluate structural stability and generalizability. Composite scale scores were regressed against indicator variables \textendash{} including the Food Involvement Scale (FIS) and self-reported meals cooked at home \textendash{} to assess construct validity. Close model fit was achieved using 28 items on three subscales: Food Self-Efficacy, which comprises self-perceptions of cooking and provisioning abilities; Food Attitude, which comprises attitudes towards food and cooking; and Structure, the influence of non-food barriers on provisioning. The model was generalizable up to partial-scalar invariance across samples. In linear regression, CAFPAS scores significantly predicted reported meals cooked per week (+1 meal/week per unit increase in CAFPAS). Thus, the CAFPAS is a structurally valid tool, based in a novel paradigm, for evaluating cooking and food-preparation abilities.},

We wanted to determine whether a trained panel could find sensory differences between these two products. We used standard DA: 11 judges were trained for 10 hours to develop a lexicon of 24 flavor, taste, and mouthfeel descriptors for the 24 whiskey samples (15 bourbons and 9 ryes). Then, subjects rated each whiskey sample on each attribute, using unstructured line scales, in standard good sensory-evaluation conditions, and in triplicate. Results were analyzed using MANOVA, Barycentric Discriminant Analysis, and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Overall, while 10 descriptors significantly differentiated the whiskeys, no attribute or combination of attributes was predicted by mashbill: The judges did not find differences in sensory character between bourbon and rye whiskeys as categories. However, significant differences could be attributed to the producer of the whiskey and to age at bottling. These results are important because American whiskey has recently become staggeringly popular, and because there is a consistent belief that bourbon and rye whiskeys\textemdash as categories\textemdash have distinct sensory characteristics.},

Sorting does not require training analysts, allows for the easy, simultaneous presentation of up to 20 samples, and provides stable results with 25\textendash 30 subjects. However, wide use of free-sorting is hindered by the current analyses for free sorting\textemdash for example DISTATIS and Correspondence Analysis\textemdash which require statistical expertise to conduct and interpret. In this paper a novel, alternative analysis is proposed, called ``Sorting Backbone Analysis'' (SBA), which is based on tools from network analysis. The similarity data produced from free sorting can represent a weighted network, and so a set of network-analysis tools can be used to identify groups of products which are significantly similar, and to visualize these results clearly and powerfully. SBA is simple and can be implemented with open-source software, provides interpretations that agree with current methods, and produces clear, powerful visualizations called ``graphs,'' which may offer new, interpretable insights to sensory scientists. This paper describes the mathematical and statistical background for SBA and applies SBA to four, previously published sorting datasets, with comparisons to DISTATIS. In each case SBA produces visual results that highlight all of the same features as the standard approach while being easier to interpret, and in many cases produces new insights. Therefore, SBA specifically and network analysis in general are suggested as new approaches for use in the analysis of sensory similarity data as produced through free sorting and related methods.},

  abstract = {``Free sorting'', in which subjects are asked to sort a set of items into groups of ``most similar'' items, is increasingly popular as a technique for profiling sets of foods. However, free sorting implies an unrealistic model of sample similarity: that similarity is purely binary (is/is not similar) and that similarity is fully transitive (similarities \{A, B\} and \{B, C\} imply \{A, C\}). This paper proposes a new method of rapid similarity testing\textemdash the ``free-linking'' task\textemdash that solves both problems: in free linking, subjects draw a similarity graph in which they connect pairs of samples with a line if they are similar, according to the subject's individual criteria. This simple task provides a more realistic model of similarity which allows degrees of similarity through the graph distance metric and does not require transitive similarity. In two pilot studies with spice blends (10 samples, 58 subjects) and chocolate bars (10 samples, 63 subjects), free linking and free sorting are evaluated and compared using DISTATIS, RVb, and the graph parameters degree, transitivity, and connectivity; subjects also indicated their preferences and ease-of-use for the tasks. In both studies, the first two dimensions of the DISTATIS consensus were highly comparable across tasks; however, free linking provided more discrimination in dimensions three and four. RVb stability was equivalent for the two methods. Graph statistics indicated that free linking had greater discrimination power: on average subjects made similarity groupings with lower degree, lower transitivity, and higher connectivity for free linking in both studies. However, subjects did overall find free sorting easier and liked it more, indicating a higher cognitive difficulty of free linking. The free-linking task, therefore, provides more robust, realistic similarity maps at the cost of higher panelist effort, and should prove a valuable alternative for rapid sensory assessment of product sets.},

Subjects were trained to identify the components presented alone and to use a `yes/no' procedure to identify them in mixtures. All stimuli were presented with a retronasal (by mouth) technique. A maximum of three tastants were identified in both types of mixtures, only one tastant was identified in five-component taste mixtures, and no component was identified in four-component odour \^ taste mixtures. Importantly, in no instance was the olfactory stimulus identified in any mixture with tastes, including binary mixtures. Loss of identity of the odorant in binary and ternary mixtures may have been due to suppression as a consequence of temporal processing, or to the absence of an association between the odorant and tastants that had established an identifiable percept. In contrast, poor identification of the components of the quaternary odour \^ taste mixture and quinternary taste mixture is attributed to the limited capacity of working memory. Overall, the poorer ability to identify components in odour \^ taste mixtures than in taste mixtures indicates that interactions occurred between the two senses, challenging the proposal that odours and tastes are processed independently when present in complex chemosensory stimuli.},

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

The layman may wonder what are the major types of single malts that can be recognized, and what are their chief characteristics and best representatives, whether there is a geographical component in that classification and whether the various categories of characteristics lead to the same classification. This paper provides an answer to these questions, applying an array of statistical methods to a database derived from a connoisseur's description of these liquors. The taster's literary descriptions of Scotches were turned into a numerical database (109 Scotches x68 binary variables). A first classification was produced by distance computation and hierarchical clustering. Since it was significantly related to the regions of Scotland, a second classification was computed with a spatial contiguity constraint, to divide Scotland into regions where Scotches are homogeneous in their organoleptic characteristics. To explore the congruence of the categories of characteristics, the five databases corresponding to nose, colour, body, palate and finish characteristics were compared by using statistical tests of significance: among the raw data tables, among distance matrices and among classifications derived from these distance matrices. Most types of characteristic lead to congruent results, despite the loss of information that occurs when moving from one level to the next.},

Methods: Secondary data analysis of a 10-week, 10-lesson school-based nutrition education intervention among 3rd grade students (N = 952). Nutrition self-efficacy (7 items) and nutrition outcome expectations (9 items) were measured through student self-report at intervention pre- (time 1) and post(time 2) assessments. A series of two time point, multi-group cross-lagged bivariate change score models were used to determine the direction of the relationship. Results: A cross lag from nutrition selfefficacy at time 1 predicting changes in nutrition outcome expectations at time 2 significantly improved the fit of the model (Model 3), whereas a cross lag from nutrition outcome expectations at time 1 to changes in nutrition self-efficacy at time 2 only slightly improved the fit of the model (Model 2). Furthermore, adding both cross lags (Model 4) did not improve model fit compared to the model with only the self-efficacy cross lag (Model 3). Lastly, the nutrition outcome expectations cross lag did not significantly predict changes in nutrition self-efficacy in any of the models. Conclusions: Data suggest that there is a unidirectional relationship between nutrition self-efficacy and outcome expectations, in which selfefficacy predicts outcome expectations. Therefore, theory-based nutrition interventions may consider focusing more resources on changing self-efficacy because it may also lead to changes in outcome expectations as well.},

Specific odor knowledge, such as perceived familiarity and identifiability, is strongly and positively related to episodic odor memory performance. Age-related impairments in various olfactory and cognitive parameters and the potential detrimental effects in episodic odor memory are discussed.

In the taste context the authors define holistic processing as nonverbal, imagery-based, and involving narrative processing. The authors conduct qualitative interviews with taste experts (Master Sommeliers) to operationalize the holistic approach to hedonic learning, and then test it against traditional analytic methods in a series of experiments across a range of hedonic products. The results suggest that hedonic learning follows a sequence of stages whose order matters, and that the holistic stage is facilitated by attending to experience as a narrative event and by employing visual imagery. The results of this multimethod investigation have implications for both managers and academics interested in how consumers learn to become expert in hedonic product categories.},

Drawing on three specimen data fragments from contrasting family settings, routinely used resources for pursuing completion and expressing satiety are described. We show how checks on completion are tailored to children according to their age, the intimate knowledge family members have of one another and attuned to contingencies, such as, whether there is a further course to be offered. Equally, that in teaching children how to eat together with others, the family also transmits and transforms all manner of other eating practices such as how to comply, or not, with requests to finish. A central aim of the article is to complement the many studies of satiety that have explained its physiological aspects by providing the familial logics that are expressed in bringing the meal to a close. We offer a suggestive analysis, based on conversation analytic principles, to illustrate our argument and to provide a starting point for further work in this field. Where bodies of work have previously used mealtimes as a convenient setting for accessing other social practices, this article turns its focus back toward the tasks of dining together.},

The TFEQ-R18 measures 3 aspects of eating behavior: cognitive restraint (CR), uncontrolled eating (UE), and emotional eating. Reported food intake was calculated from a food frequency questionnaire. Girls who scored higher on restrained eating had a lower energy intake than the other girls (9164 kJ vs. 13,163 kJ, P {$<$} 0.001). In adult men, energy intake increased with UE (9663 kJ vs. 11,029 kJ in the lower and higher UE tertiles, respectively, P {$<$} 0.05). When specific food groups were analyzed, higher CR was positively associated in adults with healthy food groups like green vegetables [OR = 1.92 (0.68\textendash 2.44)] and negatively associated with French fries [OR = 0.35 (0.22\textendash 0.57)] and sugar [OR = 0.38 (0.23\textendash 0.61)]. Energy-dense foods, such as fat, were positively associated with UE [OR = 2.28 (1.46\textendash 3.57) for dietary fat]. Finally, emotional eaters had a higher snacking food intake. In teenagers and young adults, most associations were seen with CR. Converse to observations in adults, teenagers and young adults who exhibited a high cognitive restraint reported consumption of fewer energy-dense foods rather than more ``healthy foods.'' The TFEQ-R18 was therefore able to distinguish among different eating patterns in our sample of a French general population.},

Descriptive analysis uses a trained panel to specify the intensities of speci\textregistered c attributes, based on a psychophysical model for intensity scaling. However, the use of descriptive techniques for complex and well-blended aromas gives rise to several problems. The psychophysical intensity model based upon independent odor notes may be a poor way to characterize odor experience, bringing into question whether descriptive analysis is an adequate tool for sensory analysis of complex smells. These problems include the following: (1) disagreement among experts in the most prominent odor notes of a single product and other individual dierences problems, (2) a correspondence between similarity scaling and intensity scaling, (3) the substitution of applicability measures for intensity, (4) the need to use mid-tier, general odor terms for pro\textregistered ling complex fragrances, and (5) blending and integration eects. Data will be presented on citrus{$\pm$}woody mixtures showing that ratings of similarity and intensity are highly correlated, suggesting a common underlying process for both ratings. A related issue concerns whether odors and their mixtures are perceived as unitary or analyzable percepts. With these same stimuli, the perception of singularity vs. mixed-ness of stimuli is dicult to predict. Sensory scientists should question the validity of descriptive data for such stimuli and avoid the simplistic mistake of equating data with perception. The use of simple and apparently independent intensity scales may produce the illusion that the odor experience is a collection of independent analyzable ``notes'' when it is not. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The LAM is a line scale anchored at its end points with the phrases ``greatest imaginable like'' and ``greatest imaginable dislike'' and uses as intermediate anchors the nine phrases of the traditional hedonic scale. In this study, three hedonic scales were compared, including the widely-used 9-point hedonic scale, the LAM scale, and an 11-point category scale using the LAM's verbal anchors as category labels. Three groups of consumers (N = about 100 each) used one of the three scales to evaluate the acceptability of highly liked foods (orange juices, potato chips, cookies, and ice cream, with four samples of each). Scales were evaluated primarily on their ability to show differences in acceptability, the correspondence of acceptance ratings to preference ranking and the correspondence of stated product usage (e.g., purchase of pulp vs. non-pulp orange juice) to the product scoring highest. All three scales performed equally well, with no one scale showing a consistent superiority over another. All three scales were able to differentiate acceptability of the orange juices, chips and cookies. No scale differentiated among the ice creams, which had equal and high acceptability. All scales showed a strong correspondence between liking and preference rankings and also between the product rated highest and the type of product usually consumed, within each of the product categories.},

The manual includes introductory information, such as report formats (both academic and industrial), as well as a series of eleven full-length lab exercises suitable for a three-hour laboratory period. There are also four shorter exercises suitable for a traditional class period, and one group exercise suitable for a semester project in descriptive analysis and terminology building. Correct use of graphs, tables and statistics is emphasized in several sections. Each exercise includes both a student section and one for instructors and teaching assistants, which features detailed instructions with supplies, equipment, preparation procedures, ballots and data sheets. Each instructor section also includes "key to successful execution", which cover common mistakes and important details, designed to give the students the maximum opportunity for a rich learning experience. A group of statistical problem sets is included to reinforce common statistical analyses used with sensory data. Methods encountered include discrimination, descriptive, affective/hedonic, scaling, thresholds, panelist screening, shelf life and consumer questionnaires. Critical thinking and discussion questions are emphasized above and beyond the rote learning of a specific procedure. For classes that may be offered to less advanced students, suggestions are made in the instructor sections on how the exercise or report can be simplified. The exercises were compiled and refined over two decades and used in an upper level course in sensory testing at Cornell University."--},

The development stage includes reviewing protocols before evaluation ensues, generating terms and definitions that describe the products, selecting references that clarify the terms, reviewing examples to further train the panel on important attributes, and finalizing the lexicon. Examples of published lexicons exist for foods, beverages, home care products, personal care products and fragrances. Publishing lexicons is beneficial because it promotes standardization of sensory vocabulary across multiple panels, companies and countries. Ideally, a published lexicon has the complete list of products from which it was developed, all attribute terms, definitions for every attribute and references for every attribute.},

Scotch whiskies are perceived as having distinctive characters, generally recognised in pattern recognition (perception, macroscopic brain processing), rather than being subjected to a deconstruction process of evaluating attributes (sensation, microscopic brain processing). Although consumers use simple recognition judgements on whisky flavour in categorical assimilation, industry has a requirement for monitoring spirit quality that necessitates a more reductionist approach. Whisky flavour wheels identify attributes, specific components of flavour character, which can be demonstrated to sensory assessors using reference standards. The advent of cyclodextrin bound reference standards has enabled communication of information on flavour character in training of assessors, as exploited in the brewing industry. A revised flavour wheel, with characters illustrated by reference standards, is proposed to assist sensory training on attributes of whisky flavour character.},

Not surprisingly, preference for the MIT brew was higher in the blind condition than in either of the two disclosure conditions. However, the timing of the information mattered substantially.

  abstract = {In the past, green tea has been one of the least popular nonalcoholic beverages for U.S. consumers. However, green tea has been receiving attention because of its potential health benefits. Knowing which green tea flavor attributes contribute to consumer liking will help the fast growing green tea business including green tea importers, tea shops, and beverage companies to understand which characteristics are most accepted by U.S. consumers. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine differences in acceptability of commonly available loose leaf and bagged green teas available from the major exporters to the U.S. (Japan, Korea, and China) and (2) to determine which green tea flavor characteristics are related to consumers' liking. In the study, consumers from the U.S. evaluated 6 green tea samples from China, Japan, and Korea for acceptability. A highly trained panel also evaluated the green tea samples to provide descriptive sensory attributes that might be related to acceptability. We found that U.S. consumers liked green tea samples with lower flavor intensity and lower bitterness intensity. Consumers' acceptability of green tea was negatively correlated with spinach and animalic flavor and bitterness and astringency of green teas evaluated using descriptive sensory analysis, but the correlation was only moderate. To learn what green tea flavor characteristics influence consumers' liking, future studies using more green tea samples with different flavor profiles are needed.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis has long been an untiring topic of sociology. However, until the era of information technology, the availability of data, mainly collected by the traditional method of personal survey, was highly limited and prevented largescale analysis. Recently, the exploding amount of automatically generated data has completely changed the pattern of research. For instance, the enormous amount of data from so-called high-throughput biological experiments has introduced a systematic or network viewpoint to traditional biology. Then, is ``high-throughput'' sociological data generation possible? Google, which has become one of the most influential symbols of the new Internet paradigm within the last ten years, might provide torrents of data sources for such study in this (now and forthcoming) digital era. We investigate social networks between people by extracting information on the Web and introduce new tools of analysis of such networks in the context of statistical physics of complex systems or socio-physics. As a concrete and illustrative example, the members of the 109th United States Senate are analyzed and it is demonstrated that the methods of construction and analysis are applicable to various other weighted networks.},

The first and second brews of the green tea samples provided similar flavor intensities. The third and fourth brews provided milder flavors and lower bitterness and astringency when measured using descriptive sensory analysis. In the brewed liquor of green tea mostly linalool, nonanal, geraniol, jasmone, and {$\beta$}-ionone volatile compounds were present at low levels (using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The geraniol, linalool, and linalool oxide compounds in green tea may contribute to the floral/perfumy flavor. Green teas in leaf form may be brewed up to four times: the first two brews providing stronger flavor, bitterness, and astringency whereas the third and fourth brews will provide milder flavor, bitterness, and astringency.},

In the present study, 115 participants recruited from a local shopping mall were asked to taste and evaluate three paired food samples (i.e., cookies, potato chips, and yogurt). Each of those food samples was labeled, specifying one of the items in the pair as `organic' and the other label specifying its counterpart as `regular', although they were identical and organically produced. Results found that participants estimated those foods with organic labels to be lower in calories than those without the organic label. Furthermore, foods with the organic label elicited a higher willingness-to-pay and yielded better nutritional evaluations (e.g., tastes lower in fat, higher in fiber) than foods without the organic label. Finally, results found that the effects of the organic label on caloric estimations were less pronounced among people who typically read nutritional labels, who often buy organic foods, and who often engage in pro-environmental activities. This underscores the idea that the health halo effect is primarily driven by automatic processing based on heuristics. Understanding how consumers use nutritional information on product labels has important implications for both public policy as well as processed food manufacturers who use such claims as tools to market their products.},

Telephone interviews about diet and health conducted with randomly sampled physicians and laypersons in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the USA revealed substantial cultural/national differences and few differences between physicians and laypersons of the same country. Three different measures of similarity converged in supporting the claim that in the areas of diet and health, physicians resemble their countrymen more than they resemble physicians from other Western countries. The degree to which differences in culture- and nation-mediated medical education influence these results is to be determined.},

In a first part, participants sorted nine commercial beers and then described each group with their own words or with a list of terms. In a second part, participants were asked to match each beer with one of their own sets of descriptors. The matching task was used to evaluate the validity of the sorting task to describe products. Results showed that (1) the categories of trained and untrained assessors were comparable, (2) trained and untrained assessors did not describe groups of beers similarly, (3) for both groups, the results of matching task were not very good and presented a high inter-variability, and (4) providing a list of terms did not seem to help the assessors. Overall, the results suggest that the sorting task followed by a description does not seem to be adapted for a precise and reliable description of complex products such as beers but may be an interesting tool to probe assessors' perception.},

In this paper, we address this question by exploring the criteria used by trained and untrained assessors when they categorize beers. Two experimental factors were manipulated: beer color and brewery. Participants sorted nine commercial beers coming in three different colors and from three different breweries. Participants sorted in two different conditions: in one condition, participants could see the beers, and in the other condition, they could not see the beers. We observed that in both tasting conditions (i.e., with or without vision), trained and untrained assessors categorized beers similarly. In the visual condition, assessors sorted beers by color, whereas in the blind condition, they sorted them by brewery. Overall, our results indicate that sensory training does not seem to have an effect on the criteria used to organize beer perceptions. This suggests that our trained beer assessors did not develop specific conceptual representations of beers during training. Moreover, it seems that when assessors categorize beers, they rely more on visual than on chemosensory information.},

Depending on the winery operations or the style of wine made, the winemaker can be viewed as the expert crafting an artisan wine or producing a commercial alcoholic beverage designed to appeal to many consumers. The globalization of the wine market now enables more consumers to taste wines produced in foreign regions. Winemakers producing popular wines have been challenged by evolving consumer needs, values, and motivations for drinking wines, consumption habits, and greater product competition. This review discusses the tools sensory evaluation provides to assist winery operations by characterizing wine sensory properties and by better understanding consumer preferences in order to design better wine styles. By reviewing the scientific and marketing literature, key concepts are illustrated and new perspectives for consumer-driven winemaking and wine business strategies are proposed.},

While many studies have focused on predictors of food insecurity, fewer studies have examined how food insecurity affects diet and diet-related outcomes among college students. Objective The objective of this study was to examine differences in dietary intake, food and cooking agency, and body mass index (calculated as kg/m2) by food security status in a sample of college students at a large, public midwestern university. Design We conducted a cross-sectional online survey administered from March to June 2018. Participants Students were recruited from a random sample (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}2,000) provided by the university, which included an oversample of minority racial/ethnic students from lower-income households and first-generation students. The response rate was 43\% (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}851). After excluding students with missing data, the final sample was 754 enrolled students. Main outcome measures Food security status was measured using the US Adult Food Security Survey Module. Dietary intake was assessed using the National Cancer Institute dietary screener questionnaire. Cooking and food agency was measured using the Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale, a new validated questionnaire. Body mass index was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Statistical analysis performed Differences between food security categories and dietrelated outcomes were examined using generalized linear models. Models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates, such as student's age, sex, race/ethnicity, and receipt of financial aid. Results Compared to students with high food security, low food security was associated with lower intake of fruits, and very low food security was associated with higher intakes of total added sugar and added sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages. Marginal and very low food security were positively associated with body mass index. Marginal, low, and very low food security were inversely associated with cooking and food agency. Conclusions Students with food insecurity experience diet-related challenges that could translate into health disparities over time. More research is needed to understand the longitudinal effects of food insecurity on student health and well being.},

The influence of repeated exposure on the development of preference is also studied. The first study compares three soft drinks, in a design based on an alternation of laboratory measurements and home exposure to one of the drinks by different groups. The second one consists of repeated measurements at home of all three drinks (spirits this time). The results of both experiments question the stability of preferences. A considerable amount of preference change is observed within sessions, and a development of preference over sessions is clearly shown in the choice behavior, but not in the hedonic judgement. According to psychological theories, the wish for perceptual variety, the exploratory context of exposure, stimulus properties like novelty and complexity, and the individual state of the subject are among the factors that might explain such preference changes. Finally, difficulties encountered in the construction of adequate methods for the measurement of dynamic preferences, are discussed. \textcopyright},

Mathematics anxiety and test anxiety were positively correlated with the number of voluntary reassessments students attempted, while communication apprehension was negatively correlated. These findings indicate that standards-based grading is an assessment framework that can provide alternate methods for some students to demonstrate content mastery. While this study was conducted in mathematics courses, the findings on test anxiety are likely to extend to other disciplines.},

Pictures from the Chinese Affective Picture System (CAPS) and other online websites were selected, evaluated and reorganized according to the participants' he\- donic and arousal ratings. The pictures were then divided into positive, neutral and negative groups according to their hedonic ratings. Each affective group was subdivided into mild, medium and strong sensations according to the arousal ratings. During the experiments, the participants were shown the pictures and were instructed to choose one of the four taste words (sour/sweet/bitter/salty) as an immediate response. The results showed that positive affective pictures were significantly associated with the word sweet. When the arousal of the positive pictures increased, the choice ratio of ``sweet'' increased. Negative pictures, with low to medium arousal, were significantly associated with ``sour''. Negative and neutral pictures, with strong arousal, were significantly associated with ``bitter''. Neutral pictures, with mild to medium arousal, were not significantly associated with any taste word.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems \textemdash{} false alarms, misses, and inversions \textemdash{} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

  abstract = {Excessive sugar intake is a global public health concern, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) represent one of the main sources of added sugar in the diet. In this sense, the inclusion of front of pack (FOP) nutritional schemes and food reformulation are strategies that could contribute to reduce sugar consumption and improve population health status. The aims of this work were to evaluate adults and children's choice of sugar-reduced drinks in the context of the implementation of FOP nutrition labelling under different evaluation conditions, and to compare the influence of two FOP nutrition labelling schemes: the traffic-light system (TLS) and nutritional warnings. For that, 400 adults and 400 children (6\textendash 12 years old) divided in 2 groups (n = 200) each chose samples of grape nectar or chocolate flavoured milk (control and two sugar reduction levels) featuring different FOP nutritional schemes, under three experimental conditions: (a) blind, tasting the samples without any information, (b) expected, looking at the packages, and (c) informed, looking at the packages and tasting the samples. In each experimental condition, participants were asked to choose one of the three products. Both FOP schemes encouraged adults and children's to choose for healthier products under the expected condition. In the case of adults, nutritional warnings outperformed the traffic light system in the task involving grape nectars. However, when participants tasted the products (blind and informed conditions), choices were defined by their sensory characteristics and the control samples without sugar reduction were the most frequently selected. These results indicate that consumers' hedonic experience overrode the effect of FOP nutrition labelling and suggest that this public policy is unlikely to have a real effect on consumers' choices if there are no healthy alternatives that meet their sensory and hedonic expectations.},

In this context, the aim of the present study was to determine the compromised acceptance threshold (CAT) and the hedonic rejection threshold (HRT) of sodium concentration in hamburger meat. Furthermore, these thresholds were also determined by targeting sensory attributes (aroma, texture, flavor, and overall impression). The reduction in sodium concentration led to a shift in the acceptances of flavor (CATf = 0.631\%), aroma (CATa = 0.630\%), overall impression (CAToi = 0.601\%) and texture (CATt = 0,482\%). This depreciation, however, did not result in sensory rejection of the hamburger aroma and texture. On the other hand, a sensory rejection started to occur for both flavor and overall impression when the sodium concentration reached values of 0.170\% and 0.014\%, respectively. CAT and HRT directional determinations were found to provide useful information for food industries. This indicates the acceptance and rejection of each of the aforementioned attributes that are those most affected by stimulus variation (sodium reduction). Moreover, the reported outcome should stimulate sodium reduction in foods.},

However, MTurk was not intended to be a research tool, and many common research tasks are difficult and time-consuming to implement as a result. TurkPrime was designed as a research platform that integrates with MTurk and supports tasks that are common to the social and behavioral sciences. Like MTurk, TurkPrime is an Internet-based platform that runs on any browser and does not require any downloads or installation. Tasks that can be implemented with TurkPrime include: excluding participants on the basis of previous participation, longitudinal studies, making changes to a study while it is running, automating the approval process, increasing the speed of data collection, sending bulk e-mails and bonuses, enhancing communication with participants, monitoring dropout and engagement rates, providing enhanced sampling options, and many others. This article describes how TurkPrime saves time and resources, improves data quality, and allows researchers to design and implement studies that were previously very difficult or impossible to carry out on MTurk. TurkPrime is designed as a research tool whose aim is to improve the quality of the crowdsourcing data collection process. Various features have been and continue to be implemented on the basis of feedback from the research community. TurkPrime is a free research platform.},

However, high frequency words in one topic may be also used with high frequency in other topics. Thus they may not be the best words to characterize the topic. In this paper, we propose a new method for topic detection, where a topic is determined by identifying words that appear with high frequency in the topic and low frequency in other topics. We model patterns of word co- occurrence and co-occurrences of those patterns using a hierarchy of discrete latent variables. The states of the latent variables represent clusters of documents and they are interpreted as topics. The words that best distinguish a cluster from other clusters are selected to characterize the topic. Empirical results show that the new method yields topics with clearer thematic characterizations than the alternative approaches.},

The individual chemical stimuli were 7 common dissimilar odorants of equal moderate intensity. An air dilution olfactometer delivered a single odorant or a mixture containing up to 5 odorants. The results indicated that for both panels only 3 or 4 components of a complex mixture could be discriminated and identified and that this capacity could not be increased by training.

We discuss its use and benefits and compare its outcomes to alternative methods for the analysis of multiblock data arising in situations such as projective mapping and free sorting experiments. More importantly, a method of clustering a collection of datasets measured on the same individuals, called CLUSTATIS, is introduced. It is based on the optimization of a criterion and consists in a hierarchical cluster analysis and a partitioning algorithm akin to the K-means algorithm. The procedure of analysis can be seen as an extension of the cluster analysis of variables around latent components (CLV, Vigneau \& Qannari, 2003) to the case of blocks of variables. Alongside the determination of the clusters, a latent configuration is determined by the STATIS method. The interest of CLUSTATIS in sensometrics is discussed and illustrated on the basis of two case studies pertaining to the projective mapping also called Napping and the free sorting tasks, respectively.},

This research uses a discrete choice experiment approach to understand how key extrinsic cues are used by different consumer groups when choosing wine. We extend common practice by using a simulation algorithm to show how relative purchase rate changes as brand, region, price, and award are changed. The results show that low involvement consumers use price and award to a greater degree than high involvement consumers. A gold medal increases the choice probability the most, but mainly at the lower and middle price points, and a well known region amplifies the desirability of small brands more than large brands. The results are complex across the four factors and two levels of involvement, but provide a realistic appraisal of how consumers use extrinsic cues in combination when choosing wines. The strong differences in choice behavior between low and high involvement consumers show this to be a viable segmentation strategy and one that other researchers should consider utilizing.},

Design: Concurrent administration of ecSI with validated measures of eating behaviors using on-line and paper-pencil formats. Setting: The on-line survey was completed by 370 participants; 462 completed the paper version. Participants: Participants included 863 adults with 832 usable surveys from respondents (mean age 36.2 Ϯ 13.4 years) without eating disorders, mostly female, white, educated, overweight, physically active, and food secure. Of those indicating intent to complete the on-line survey, 80.3\% did so; 54\% of mailed surveys were returned. Variables Measured: Eating and food behaviors compared among EC tertiles and between dichotomous EC categories; internal consistency of ecSI. Analysis: Analysis of variance, independent t tests, chi-square, factor analysis, logistic regression. Significance level was P Ͻ .05. Results: Mean ecSI score was 31.1 Ϯ 7.5. ecSI included 4 subscales with internal reliability and content validity. Construct validity was supported by specific behavioral profiles for ecSI tertiles and ecSI dichotomized categories. Persons unsatisfied with weight were 54\% less likely to be EC; unit increase in the food like index was associated with nearly 3 times greater likelihood of being EC. Conclusions and Implications: The ecSatter Inventory is a valid measure of EC and can be used for descriptive and outcome measurements.},

A 16-item instrument to measure eating competence, the Satter Eating Competence Inventory was previously validated in a general sample and subsequently, a 16-item instrument was developed to address specific concerns of low-income persons; 12 items were common to both instruments. The purpose of this study was to determine if the low-income version could be applied to a general audience, simplifying intervention evaluation and facilitating cross-study comparison. Both surveys were fully completed by 127 parents (89\% white; 35.8 {$\pm$} 5.3 y; 86\% college graduates; 51\% eating competent) of preschool-age children; 96 of whom were not considered low-income. Cognitive interviews with 14 parents of varying eating competence levels clarified and confirmed findings. Scores were highly correlated (r = .98) and only 2 of the 96 were not congruently classified for eating competence. Mean difference between the two versions was .24 {$\pm$} 1.55. The general audience version explained 95\% of the variance in the lowincome version score. Findings support the low-income version of the Satter Eating Competence Inventory for general audience use as the Satter Eating Competence Inventory 2.0.},

  abstract = {In recent years a new form of food production and distribution organisation, as part of small-scale and local agriculture, has been gaining ground. Generically termed short supply chains (SSCs), this new model of food procurement comprises various forms such as community-supported agriculture, box schemes and solidarity purchase groups. Consumer participation in SSCs is dictated by deep motivations: while consumers are principally encouraged by the desire to preserve local producers, as well as the social and environmental aspects of farming, the attraction of SSCs is also tied to different and more complex ways of perceiving food quality. The quality issue in SSCs is not only seen in the light of classic attributes, such as taste and safety, but also in terms of social criteria built on the basis of aspects of products linked to social and environmental domains. This study provides an empirical assessment of consumers participating in SSCs to ascertain whether, and to what extent, those actively involved in an SSC show differences in terms of what is more personal and subjective, such as universal values and food-related lifestyles, compared with those who do not participate. In order to assess such relationships, data were collected from a solidarity purchase group in Sicily (southern Italy). For comparison, a group of consumers in conventional food outlets were also interviewed in the same city. Data were analysed with the propensity score matching method. Our results show that the decision to participate in a solidarity purchase group is especially dictated by profound ideological and emotional considerations. They emphasise the interest in preserving, protecting and sustaining the welfare of other people, in line with the fundamental purpose of short supply chains.},

Some attributes were found in most or all samples, but many attributes were found in only one or a few samples. All 37 samples had distinctly different flavor attributes and intensities in both crumb and crust samples. The principal components analysis for crumb and crust indicated that the number of attributes could not be reduced into a smaller set of components that completely described the wide range of breads used in this study.

Drawing upon Igor Kopytoff's descriptions of commoditization as process, this paper argues that the products and the values they embody, which Slow Food has identified for their singularity, are commoditized through a variety of mechanisms. This paper then argues that commoditization makes the endeavors of Slow Food resemble the conventional agricultural system it is trying to oppose, as well as undermining the very agrobiodiversity the organization seeks to protect. These effects create a disconnect between the organization's goals and its actions on-the-ground, indicating that Slow Food is not as alternative as it claims to be. This paper ends by examining Slow Food's role within the overall agricultural system, and suggests that the organization's producers are important guardians of the global agrobiodiversity which conventional production erodes.},

The aim of the present research is to explore the effect of ethically labeled foods and drinks (e.g., Fair Trade) on consumers' reported taste experience. In three studies, we asked participants to taste coffee (Study 1) or chocolate (Studies 2 and 3), and participants in all studies reported that the products tasted significantly better when they were labeled Fair Trade. Moreover, prior to rating the products, the majority of participants in Studies 2 and 3 indicated that they did not believe products with ethical labels to taste differently. Yet, even the participants who explicitly made this claim reported that the chocolate tasted better when it was labeled Fair Trade. Additionally, Study 3 suggests affect as a critical variable mediating this effect. Thus, consumers rate Fair Trade products more positively, because they experience positive affect through consumption of ethical goods. We discuss this result with respect to consumers and producers, and we argue that the observed effect can increase value for both.},

In a product development context, consumers are more and more integrated in the process: how integrate them in the most efficient way? Whereas formatted measures can be easily analysed but are far from the consumers, measures that seem to be closer to the consumers are often very difficult to analyse. A trade-off has to be found, in order to get data that are, at the same time, as close as possible to consumers' mind and relevant for the ones who develop new products. In this context, we proposed a new strategy, based on the nudge theory, called ``Free JAR Profiling''. Its first step invites consumers to classify products into 3 hedonic categories. This classification impact consumers' speeches in a soft way as it places consumers in a hedonic state of mind and allows them to easily structure their thoughts toward product improvement keys. The second step invites consumers to assess the products according to their own vocabulary, but with a constraint on how they give their opinion, based on a JAR scale. This strategy allows to have access to oriented and structured data, which mix the consumer spontaneity strength and the R\&D approach of JAR scales. The added-value and the relevance of these nudged data can be checked, and a Sentiment Mapping can be performed as a results representation.},

Social media has fundamentally changed the way we communicate, collaborate, consume, and create content. The ease with which content can be shared has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of individuals or organisations that seek to influence opinion and the volume of content that they generate. The nutrition and diet domain is not immune to this phenomenon. Unfortunately, from a public health perspective, many of these `influencers' may be poorly qualified in order to provide nutritional or dietary guidance, and advice given may be without accepted scientific evidence and contrary to public health policy. In this preliminary study, we analyse the `healthy diet' discourse on Twitter. While using a multi-component analytical approach, we analyse more than 1.2 million English language tweets over a 16-month period in order to identify and characterise the influential actors and discover topics of interest in the discourse. Our analysis suggests that the discourse is dominated by non-health professionals. There is widespread use of bots that pollute the discourse and seek to create a false equivalence on the efficacy of a particular nutritional strategy or diet. Topic modelling suggests a significant focus on diet, nutrition, exercise, weight, disease, and quality of life. Public health policy makers and professional nutritionists need to consider what interventions can be taken in order to counteract the influence of non-professional and bad actors on social media.},

  abstract = {Abstract The term ?cider? refers to the fermented beverage produced from apples. The rapid growth in the cider industry coupled with the prominence of traditional, or craft, approaches emphasizes the need for research on cider production. A common problem in ciders is the production of sulfur off-aromas by yeast during fermentation. Prefermentation juice clarification has the potential to reduce the occurrence of unwanted sulfur off-aromas. Concerns that prefermentation juice clarification will reduce the yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) and polyphenols in the juice have limited the application of this practice by cider makers. In this study, 3 clarification methods were applied to ?York? apple juice, that is, static settling, centrifugation, and pectinase. Raw (control) and clarified juice were fermented to cider, and the impact of clarification on the physicochemical parameters, amino acids and polyphenol content of the juice and cider was assessed. Juice clarification by pectinase decreased YAN by 50\%, while static settling and centrifugation increased the concentration of most amino acids by 83\%. All clarification treatments lowered the concentration of total polyphenols in the juice (from 60\% to 30\%, P {$<$} 0.05) and affected the individual polyphenols in the juice but these changes were not evident in the ciders. These findings demonstrate that prefermentation juice clarification results in changes in the chemistry profiles of apple juice. These changes were however not evident in the ciders. This approach therefore has the potential to limit the production of sulfur off-aromas during cider production without adverse effects on quality. Practical Application Clarification of apple juice changes polyphenol and nitrogen contents, factors known to affect cider quality. However, these differences in the chemical profile of apple juice may not be reflected in the finished ciders. These findings demonstrate that juice clarification can be employed in cider making without affecting the quality. Cider makers should not assume that changes in apple juice imparted by clarification will be reflected in the finished ciders. Outcomes should be measured in finished ciders, rather than juice to accurately evaluate effects of the processing steps on quality.},

  abstract = {Amino acids and ammonium ions constitute the yeast assimilable nitrogen naturally present in apple juice, with free amino acids being the major constituent. Little information is available on the extent to which free amino acid composition in apple (Malus ? domestica Borkh.) juice varies among juices used for fermentation. Twenty amino acids were quantified by UPLC-PDA in juices from 13 apple cultivars grown in Virginia with potential use in cider making. The relative amino acid profile was significantly different among the apple juices evaluated. The total amino acid concentration ranged from 18~mg/L in Blacktwig juice to 57~mg/L in Enterprise juice. l-Asparagine, l-aspartic acid and l-glutamine are the principal amino acids observed in most apple juices. Our results indicate that the relative concentration of amino acids in apples is different from that found in Vitis vinifera wine grapes, which are rich in l-proline and l-arginine. The impact of these differences on fermentation of apple juice by wine yeast strains warrants further research, as the amino acid composition of grape juice impacts wine quality both directly and indirectly via yeast metabolism. These results will inform future research on yeast metabolism and nitrogen management during cider fermentation. ? 2018 The Authors Journal of the Institute of Brewing published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd on behalf of The Institute of Brewing \& Distilling},

Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts revealed two substantial features of hedonic eating experiences. First, they encompass a variety of components: In the stimulus domain, the foods, features of the physical environment, and social factors; in the domain of the organism a specific somato-psychic state and an attitude towards hedonism; in the domain of responses preparatory activities, specific characteristics of eating behavior, and positive sensations and emotions. Second, pleasures of eating depend on a variety of external and internal conditions. External conditions go far beyond the food itself: Physical features of the environment and social factors amplify food-induced positive affective reactions and embed them in an individually unique setting. Internal conditions include motivational, cognitive and behavioral factors: People who enjoy eating have the explicit intention to enjoy, they eat slowly and focus upon salient features of foods and environments, and they often engage in social activities before, during and after the meal. Hedonic eating experiences can best be understood as ``appetite gestalten'', i.e. individually specific configurations of stimuli, organism variables, and responses. A holistic, multicomponent perspective is suggested as a framework for future research.},

Emphasizing individual differences, previous research did not pay full attention to the twofold variability of emotion-induced changes of eating (variability across both individuals and emotions). By contrast, the present paper takes into account both individual characteristics and emotion features, and specifies five classes of emotion-induced changes of eating: (1) emotional control of food choice, (2) emotional suppression of food intake, (3) impairment of cognitive eating controls, (4) eating to regulate emotions, and (5) emotioncongruent modulation of eating. These classes are distinguished by antecedent conditions, eating responses and mediating mechanisms. They point to basic functional principles underlying the relations between emotions and biologically based motives: interference, concomitance and regulation. Thus, emotion-induced changes of eating can be a result of interference of eating by emotions, a byproduct of emotions, and a consequence of regulatory processes (i.e., emotions may regulate eating, and eating may regulate emotions). r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight cheeses were selected: two soft (Mozzarella and Teleme), two medium-hard (Cheddars from Vermont and New York), two hard (Emmental and Gruy\`ere), and two blue (Gorgonzola and Stilton). The results obtained by descriptive analysis showed that the cheese had significant effects on red wine flavor. Some attributes, such as astringency, bell pepper, and oak flavor, significantly decreased when the wine was evaluated after tasting cheese. Only butter aroma was significantly enhanced by cheese. It was also found that there was no significant wine-cheese interaction effect; in other words, the effect of any given cheese is equivalent for all wines. Although there were significant effects, the overall sensory profiles of wines without prior cheese tasting and as affected by cheese were very similar.},

Trained panelists evaluated each cultivar from each season in raw and roasted forms, measuring intensities of 20 flavor attributes using descriptive analysis. The intensities of 10 of the 20 flavor attributes were higher for the roasted pecans across all cultivars. These included pecan ID, overall nutty, nutty-woody, nutty-grainlike, nutty-buttery, brown, caramelized, roasted, overall sweet, and sweet. The cultivars exhibited significant differences from one another for 8 attributes: pecan ID, nutty-buttery, caramelized, acrid, woody, oily, astringent, and bitter. Each of the cultivars displayed unique flavor profiles with some demonstrating extremes of certain attributes, for example the high astringency of ``Lakota'' or the buttery characteristics of ``Pawnee.'' These results may help pecan growers and pecan product manufacturers understand flavor differences between different varieties of pecans, both in raw and roasted states, and the changes that occur during this process.},

  abstract = {Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) and Free-Comment (FC) provide a so-called contingency table containing citation counts of words or descriptors (columns) by products (rows). This table is most often analysed using correspondence analysis (CA). CA aims at decomposing dependence between products and descriptors into axes of maximal and decreasing dependencies, which is reasonable if the dependence has been previously established by a chi-square test. However, the p-value of this test is not valid when the observations are not independent or when the contingency table contains too many low expected citation rates. In addition, rejecting independence with a chi-square test only means that at least the first CA axis captures some dependence. This paper presents a test to determine the number of axes of the CA that capture significant dependence and proposes a Monte-Carlo approach to compute valid p-values for this test. The variability in the products' coordinates in the CA space is often evaluated by means of a total bootstrap procedure. The paper proposes to rely on this test to determine the number of axes to consider for the Procrustes rotations of such a procedure. Finally, to investigate which words are cited more often for each product, the paper proposes performing Fisher's exact tests per cell on the derived contingency table obtained by reversing the CA computations on the axes capturing significant dependence. The benefits of accounting for the dimensionality of the dependence in the analyses are demonstrated on real CATA data.},

Free-Comment (FC), as a response to open-ended questions, is an interesting alternative because it removes biases due to the use of a predefined list of descriptors. In the context of a home used test (HUT), FC enables subjects to express themselves more naturally. The present study investigated the relevance of the use of FC at home for word-based sensory description of a set of products. Two groups of 60 consumers of red wines characterised four French red wines from different terroirs performing either a CATA task or a FC task. The two sensory tasks were performed at home according to sensory modality: visual, olfactory and gustatory. The first objective was to investigate whether a FC protocol can be successfully conducted at home and whether it enables the characterisation and discrimination of a set of products. The second objective was to investigate whether extrinsic sensory information affects FC descriptions. The third objective was to investigate whether CATA and FC provide comparable information in the HUT context. The results show that an FC protocol is feasible at home and that the extrinsic sensory information did not affect FC descriptions. FC enabled better characterisation and discrimination of the products than CATA. A new test of product differences based on the total bootstrap procedure was proposed to compare FC and CATA.},

Free-Comment (FC) enables the sensory characterization of a set of products freed of any issue induced by the use of a list of descriptors, but for practical reasons collecting FC descriptions concurrently to the product intake is nearly impossible. Attack-Evolution-Finish (AEF) is an alternative to TDS and TCATA that replace concurrent by retrospective data collection. In AEF, subjects are asked to choose in a list one descriptor for each of the so-called periods: Attack, Evolution, and Finish. The paper introduced Free-Comment Attack-Evolution-Finish (FC-AEF) to extend FC to temporal sensory analysis where descriptor selections of AEF are replaced by FC descriptions. FC-AEF has been used at home with 63 consumers having tasted five dark chocolates. The data were analysed product-wise and period-wise and showed that FC-AEF enabled to provide temporal discrimination and characterization of the products. The product-wise analyses identified in each period the descriptors of each product enabling this discrimination. The period-wise analyses identified for each product the descriptors generating a temporal kinetic of its perception.},

  abstract = {Consumers' hedonic appreciation is important for the commercial success of a product. To formulate appreciated products, sensory and hedonic data of some existing products are often linked to each other. Because existing products represent only a limited sensory space of investigation, asking consumers to characterize their ideal product can provide relevant additional information to understand their preferences. First, the paper investigates whether sensory drivers of liking can be derived from linking Free-Comment (FC) and hedonic data. Second, Ideal-Free-Comment (IFC) is introduced. IFC instructs consumers to describe actual products and then their ideal product thanks to FC. IFC paired with liking scoring was used in a home-use test with 483 consumers each evaluating from 1 to 14 (5.71 on average) cooked hams from a list of 30 hams representative of the French market. Based on a mixed linear model, relevant drivers of liking were identified from FC data. The panel's average ideal product was consistent with the drivers of liking. Since descriptors with opposite meanings characterized individual ideal products, a consumer segmentation based on their ideal product was performed and resulted in two segments. The two segments' ideal products mainly differed regarding their flavor. Drivers of liking and the ideal product of the smaller segment ({$\approx$} 15\% of the consumers) were not well consistent suggesting this was a noise segment. Drivers of liking based on FC data and IFC are complementary tools to understand consumers' hedonic appreciation without the use of a pre-established list of descriptors.},

Is it possible to get an agreement on sensory typicality inside a Protected Designation of Origin (POD)? When there is a consensus, which methodology can be used to describe it? Ballester (2004) suggested investigating typicality with a single question, where the assessor is asked to score if the sample is a good example or not of the type. This manner of exploring typicality has been used by number of authors afterwards (Ballester, Patris, Symoneaux, \& Valentin, 2008; Cadot, Caill\'e, Samsonc, Barbeaua, \& Cheynier, 2010; Perrin, 2008). The investigation of POD typicality is not straightforward, as it seems that there is more sensory overlapping between close POD than between wines made with different grape varieties: the results depend on the samples choice, the professional tasters selection and the POD itself.},

Linguistics, or Language, however, seems to have an ambivalent role in this undertaking. On the one hand, Language with a capital L (language as a general human capacity) is part of the problem. It was the prior focus on language (text) that led to the disregard of the senses. On the other hand, it is language (with a small ?l,? a particular tongue) that offers key insights into how other peoples conceptualize the senses. In this article, we argue that a systematic cross-cultural approach can reveal fundamental truths about the precise connections between language and the senses. Recurring failures to adequately describe the sensorium across specific languages reveal the intrinsic limits of Language. But the converse does not hold. Failures of expressibility in one language need not hold any implications for the Language faculty per se, and indeed can enlighten us about the possible experiential worlds available to human experience.},

The Jahai of the Malay Peninsula are one such group. We tested whether Jahai speakers could name smells as easily as colors in comparison to a matched English group. Using a free naming task we show on three different measures that Jahai speakers find it as easy to name odors as colors, whereas English speakers struggle with odor naming.

Data from the Mundus Vini annual wine competitions (editions) from 2014 to 2016 were used. The chemical analysis and sensory attributes were subjected to cluster analysis and logistic ridge regression to identify predictors of grand gold and gold medal awards. High ethanol levels and sugar concentrations, mainly in red wines, were observed. For both red and white wines, three clusters were identified which broadly separated grand gold from gold medal awarded wines. The discrimination of G wines was mainly due to higher scores of bitterness and green/vegetative characters in both red and white wines, and with barnyard attributes only in red wines. The prediction regression for white wines showed that the exotic fruit was the most valued sensory attribute along with the quality indicators of body and complexity. Red wines had a higher number of predictors, including positive attributes like dried fruits and spicy or negative attributes like green/vegetative and red berries. This study identified the most relevant sensory features most valued by competition jurors, which were broadly consistent with the so-called international commercial wine style.},

Our results suggest that, while CO exists for some buyers, it can be eliminated by market interactions on the part of the seller. (JEL Classifications: C93, D03, Q13)},

Detailed tracing and analysis of two laboratory experiments on taste performed in laboratories in Western Europe brings out how both turn moments in which people taste into a bodily response. At the same time, since their technical set-ups address different societal problems and varying interest groups, they stage diverging versions: a perception versus a reaction to an exposure. The article, thus, sheds light on how cultural and social norms, ideals, and practices shape the knowledge production about taste and its resulting effects.},

Frontenac is typically described as having dominant notes of cherry, black currant, plum, and spice, but to date no structured evaluation of common sensory characteristics has been performed to determine whether these characteristics are perceived in a majority of red Frontenac table wines. To develop a set of descriptors for describing the aroma of these wines, descriptive analysis was performed on six commercially produced products. In an effort to identify characteristics common to the grape, wines with different production protocols were sourced from various commercial wineries in Minnesota. Thirteen sensory descriptors that characterized the wine were defined with references. Correlation analysis indicated that attributes were discrete and not redundant. All 13 attribute descriptors were useful for describing and/or distinguishing between red Frontenac table wines.},

In total, 54 terpenoid volatiles, derived from both highland and lowland plants, were obtained by a gaseous purge-and-trap system without the use of organic solvents and then identified by automated GC/MSD-FID analysis using mass spectral libraries, retention indices, and data acquired by the authors with authentic substances. Single ion monitoring proved valuable in identifying overlapping compounds with similar spectra for the subsequent semiquantitative determination of compositions. These are displayed as radar plots. It is suggested that flavor/aroma differences in cheeses produced from animals grazing in different areas and seasons arise from species (n = 38), phenological stages (n = 8), locations (n = 4), and seasonal variation in terpenoids present (the most common were trans-\OE{$\leq$}-ocimene, limonene, and trans-\OE{$\leq$}-caryophyllene). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that distinct variations in terpenoids with differing odor descriptors and abundances were found. It is also possible that terpenes with a higher polarity are less efficiently recovered by the purge-and-trap method than compounds of lower polarity. As the radar plots display relative concentrations based on detection limits, the relative efficiency of detection for different classes of compounds needs to be taken into consideration.

  abstract = {Background and aims: There is an increasing societal concern that consumption of specific foods such as sugar might become `addictive' and, hence, promote weight gain. Claims about the addictiveness of sugar however are based largely on findings from few animal studies, whereas there is a lack of direct human evidence for symptoms of sugar-related substance dependence. The current study examined in a large sample of human participants whether foods mainly containing sugar in particular might cause `addiction-like' problems that meet clinical DSM criteria for substance dependence, and, also whether in turn this relates to body weight and negative affectivity (depressed mood). Methods: In a cross-sectional study, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1495 university students from a variety of faculties were assessed for DSM-related signs of food addiction for particular food categories (YFAS), and, also BMI and negative affectivity. Results: Results revealed that from the total sample, 95\% experienced at least one symptom of food dependence and 12.6\% met the YFAS classification for `food addiction' as related to DSM-IV criteria. The majority of respondents experienced these problems for combined high-fat savoury (30\%) and high-fat sweet (25\%) foods, whereas only a minority experienced such problems for low-fat/savoury (2\%) and mainly sugar-containing foods (5\%). Overweight correlated only with addictive-like problems for high-fat savoury and high-fat sweet foods (P {$<$} 0.0001), while this was not found for foods mainly containing sugar. Conclusion: The current findings indicate that sugary foods contribute minimally to `food dependence' and increased risk of weight gain. Instead, they are consistent with the current scientific notion that food energy density, and the unique individual experience of eating, plays an important role in determining the reward value of food and promoting excessive energy intake.},

Ongoing research in sensory science and data analysis is related to the ongoing debate about a non-reductive theory of consciousness based on psychophysical principles. Sensory science is interdisciplinary and deals with the human perception of objects by the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, etc. Perception as information processing is here understood in terms of interactions between external physical stimuli and internal mental states resulting in behavioral responses. To deal with the complex and dynamic transformation between external physical energies and internal psychological experiences, multivariate methods of data analysis are shown to be useful. Examples will be given from food science where cognition and emotion, activated by sense perception, are vital for the survival, health, and well-being of humans. These approaches may contribute to bridging the explanatory gap between the subjectively experienced and the objectively observed world. Future challenges towards deeper interdisciplinary discourses addressing mind-matter research in real-world situations are at stake.},

However, there are multiple dimensions to products and opinions, and understanding the `aspects' that contribute to users' ratings may help us to better understand their individual preferences. For example, a user's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we use our model to uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we use our model to summarize reviews, which for us means finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we use our model to recover those ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches on existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we introduce. Moreover, our model is able to `disentangle' content and sentiment words: we automatically learn content words that are indicative of a particular aspect as well as the aspect-specific sentiment words that are indicative of a particular rating.},

We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience.

There is substantial product differentiation in the market and consumers only have limited information on the utility they will receive when consumed. Thus, information is expected to be valuable. Evaluating descriptions of wine produced across the U.S., I use a hedonic price regression to explore whether the descriptions provide any new information not already available to the consumer. Initial results suggest that text descriptions are shown to lose their explanatory value when varietal and numerical ratings are included as controls. I then show that once the varietal, region, and numerical ratings are adequately controlled for, there is information in the descriptions that consumers value.},

  abstract = {Domestic cooking skills (CS) and food skills (FS) encompass multiple components, yet there is a lack of consensus on their constituent parts, inter-relatedness or measurement, leading to limited empirical support for their role in influencing dietary quality. This review assessed the measurement of CS and FS in adults ({$>$}16 years); critically examining study designs, psychometric properties of measures, theoretical basis and associations of CS/FS with diet. Electronic databases (PsychInfo), published reports and systematic reviews on cooking and home food preparation interventions (Rees et al. 2012; Reicks et al. 2014) provided 834 articles of which 26 met the inclusion criteria. Multiple CS/FS measures were identified across three study designs: qualitative; cross-sectional; and dietary interventions; conducted from 1998-2013. Most measures were not theory-based, limited psychometric data was available, with little consistency of items or scales used for CS/FS measurements. Some positive associations between CS/FS and FV intake were reported; though lasting dietary changes were uncommon. The role of psychosocial (e.g., gender, attitudes) and external factors (e.g. food availability) on CS/FS is discussed. A conceptual framework of CS/FS components is presented for future measurement facilitation, which highlights the role for CS/FS on food-related behaviour and dietary quality. This will aid future dietary intervention design.},

Applying self-determination theory, the goal of this study was to examine the role of social support as a potential moderator of the link between autonomous and controlled motivations and FV intake. Cross-sectional data from 2959 adults in the United States were analyzed. Autonomous motivation and perceived social support were positively associated with FV intake, while controlled motivation was negatively associated with FV intake. Additionally, there was evidence that the negative association between controlled motivation and FV intake was attenuated by higher levels of perceived social support. Findings suggest the need for a more comprehensive approach to understanding the role of motivation in health behaviors like FV intake and the potential roles played by friends and family in these motivational processes.},

In the training restaurants and in the student cafeterias, people selected and paid for their meals.

  abstract = {With input from oral keynote and plenary presentations at the 14th Pangborn Sensory Science Symposium in 2021, a historical timeline and selective summary of sensory and consumer science is presented. The development of the field is traced to the present time across three time periods: Period 1) an early period spanning from the 1940s to the 1970s focused on sensory evaluation; Period 2) the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the further development of sensory science, the growth of a connection with consumer research, and a rapid expansion of the topics that interested the field; and Period 3) from the 2000s onwards, with the emergence of new technologies and the movement beyond a dependence on liking in the study of products. Across periods, 18 topic areas were selected: 1) hedonics and food acceptance, 2) discrimination testing, 3) chemical senses, psychophysics and scaling, 4) descriptive profiling by trained assessors, 5) temporal methods, 6) sensory drivers of liking, 7) rapid methods, 8) contextual factors, 9) health, 10) the young and the elderly, 11) cross-cultural research, 12) psychographics, 13) expectations, 14) extrinsic product factors, 15) emotions, 16) ``beyond liking'' and sub-conscious measures, 17) wellbeing, and 18) social media and big data. Loosely, the topic areas are presented in ``period chronological order'' with topics starting earlier in the timeline of Sensory-Consumer Science being presented first. Throughout its existence, the field of Sensory-Consumer Science has been characterized by a combination of more basic academic research and more applied commercial research, with much of the method development pushed by the need to describe, differentiate and develop products, and then to research the effects of those products on consumers. The field has also been characterized by an emphasis on quantitative approaches. The paper concludes with a presentation of several continuing and emerging issues within Sensory-Consumer Science.},

The 10 beer samples covered four types of beer namely; lager, strong lager, ale and wheat beer, representing both new and more established beers on the Danish market. A trained panel consisting of nine panellists completed the sensory profiling using the following attributes; colour, body, bitter, carbonation, alcohol, fruity, floral, spicy and grainy/roasted. All attributes discriminated significantly between the beer samples. Lager beers were mainly described by the attributes grainy/roasted, bitter, alcohol and carbonation whereas the attributes fruity, spicy, body and floral primarily described the ale and wheat beers. Consumers tasted the same 10 beers in a hedonic test (affective response) and in an appropriateness test (cognitive-contextual response). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a new three-block L-shapedPLSR predicting consumer liking from both consumer background characteristics and product descriptors, were used to describe the relationships between the various sets of data. The results showed that the more established beers on the Danish market were given higher liking scores than the new types of beer; however, consumer segments were revealed. Relating the sensory profiling and the consumer tests made it possible to tell which sensory characteristics influenced consumer liking and the appropriateness of the beers in various situations and uses.},

Most of this work focuses on single layer or one-mode networks, including social networks between people or hyperlinks between websites.

Common strategies for discovering the community structure of multi-mode networks identify the communities of each mode simultaneously. Here I show that this combined approach is ineffective at discovering community structures when there are an unequal number of communities between the modes of a multi-mode network. I propose a dual-projection alternative for detecting communities in multi-mode networks that overcomes this shortcoming. The evaluation of synthetic networks with known community structures reveals that the dual-projection approach outperforms the combined approach when there are a different number of communities in the various modes. At the same time, results show that the dual-projection approach is as effective as the combined strategy when the number of communities is the same between the modes.},

As an alternative, possible class specific inter-relations among the feature vectors can be exploited for distinguishing samples into specific classes. Based on this idea, a new partial correlation coefficient metric (PCCM) based classification method is proposed. Existence of such inter-variable correlations as signatures of unique classes is established with illustrative problems. Categorized variable dependency structures are hypothesized as the basis for class discrimination. Two food quality analysis datasets with chemometrics importance are utilized as benchmark problems to compare the performance of new method with classification algorithms like LDA (linear discriminant analysis), CART, Treenet and SVM (support vector machines). The PCCM method is observed to perform well for different tests over large sets of classification experiments. Discriminating PCCM classifier also provides a quick visualization tool to diagnose complex classification problems.},

Two different data analysis approaches are considered and compared on choice probability data from a consumer study of orange juice. One of the methods is based on mixed model ANOVA of individual differences, the other approach is based on fuzzy clustering related to regression residuals. The main results show that extrinsic consumer attributes are easily and efficiently related to the sensory properties of products, allowing for interactions. The methodology estimates population or segment means and gives an overview of individual differences in choice intent or liking.},

  abstract = {Temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) is a relatively new notion to investigate the evolution of dominant sensations of a product throughout a pre-defined period like, e.g., mastication or aftertaste. It is mainly used for a description of the characteristics of each single product over time. In contrast, valid statistical inference to compare the products globally or in pairwise comparisons has not yet been developed. We close this gap by introducing a randomization test based on distances between matrices. For this purpose, TDS sequences are unfolded to data matrices with a single non-zero entry per time point (column). The sum of the Euclidean distances between these matrices is determined and serves as a test statistic for the global test. Similar statistics are employed for pairwise comparisons and for inference by attribute or time point. Re-randomizations are used to determine the null distribution and p-values, taking the original restrictions of the randomization into account. We give the details of this procedure and sketch the underlying algorithm to perform the tests. We also propose some simple graphical methods to summarize the many p-values derived from this approach (usually at least hundreds, but more often several thousands). We apply this approach to real data and show that it gives reasonable and easily interpretable results, complementing existing methods.},

Multidimensional alignment (MDA) is suggested as a useful tool to investigate the association between products and the attributes.

  abstract = {Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) questions return binary data from every subject on each product and attribute. To compare multiple samples, Cochran's Q test is widely used to analyze such two-way data, with pairwise comparisons being conducted using McNemar's test, the special case of Cochran's Q for two samples. In many applications, this approach is viable, however, in some, it has limitations, most notably (i) incomplete and/or imbalanced data; (ii) experimental designs; (iii) more complex hypotheses. If an analysis of variance (ANOVA) would be valid in the sense of respecting the nominal type I error rate, all these issues would be resolved at once. CATA data is obviously not normally distributed. Yet, comparing analyses using ANOVA and Cochran's Q, we noted F-tests for balanced designs to provide p values very close to those from Cochran's Q test, and they have been shown earlier to be at least approximately valid for Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) data. We explore whether ANOVA indeed offers a robust analysis for CATA data. To that end, we determined the randomization distribution for the respective F- and t-tests for various (balanced complete) CATA studies and compared it to the corresponding parametric distribution. The respective distributions overlap closely, suggesting that ANOVA-based tests (overall and for pairwise comparisons) are indeed valid. A limitation is found in case of very low elicitation rates across products, which leads to distinct discreteness of the randomization distribution for paired comparisons and hence the potential for slightly invalid results. Yet, even in those cases, ANOVA-based tests seem to provide a reasonable approximation for most purposes. We further discuss the properties for decreasing numbers of subjects as well as showcase applications for imbalanced data and modeling in a study using an experimental design for the products. We conclude with guidance on when the use of ANOVA for CATA data is reasonable.},

Having distinguished the two types, the paper then investigates the second - the gastronomic aesthetic - through the case study of Slow Food in Tuscany. The Slow Food movement seeks to heighten the aesthetic appreciation of typical products and works mainly through local groups and typical restaurants. Through the in-depth analysis of one such restaurant, the paper outlines three main strands in the gastronomic aesthetic: a practical aesthetics of restaurant organisation; an aesthetical-ethic of typical foods; and, an aesthetic of 'connectedness' or 'embeddedness' in which the food is seen as a reflection of surrounding socio-economic and ecological relationships.

However, it is not clear if ``nutty'' is a single term or if it takes various forms, depending on the type of product. The objective of this study was to determine whether a single nutty term could be used to describe nuttiness in all food products or if additional terms were needed. More than 200 products with potential nutty flavor, including nuts, nut spreads, grains/cereals, seeds, beans/legumes, oils, cheeses, fish, and beverages, were studied. Five ``nutty'' concepts were found and described with terms, definitions, and references with intensity ratings: overall nutty, nutty-beany, nutty-buttery, nutty-grainlike, and nutty-woody. Four of those attributes, excluding overall nutty, were single concept attributes that described subgroups of nuttiness. Specific terms, such as peanut or almond, that describe a certain type of nut but are separate from the ``nutty'' character were excluded intentionally because they do not describe nutty, they describe an overall concept flavor beyond nutty. A second panel of trained assessors was used to review the lexicon. This panel used this lexicon to describe a set of 10 products (nuts, grains, beans, seeds, cheeses) and determine if any additional attributes were needed to describe nuttiness. All of the products displayed varying intensities of the nutty attributes and the panel found no additional terms for the ``nutty'' component were needed. The development and verification of the lexicon has real-world application because it can assist in product development and quality assurance when describing foods with a ``nutty'' attribute. These terms can be applied across all food categories and is not exclusive to characterizing nuts.},

For example, the field of Sensory Science, a sub-field of Food Science, investigates human responses to food products and differentiates ``descriptive'' terms for flavors from ``ordinary'', non-descriptive language. Within the field, descriptors are generated through Descriptive Analysis, a method wherein a human panel of experts tastes multiple food products and defines descriptors. This process is both time-consuming and expensive. However, one could leverage existing data to identify and build a flavor language automatically. For example, there are thousands of professional and semi-professional reviews of whisk(e)y published on the internet, providing abundant descriptors interspersed with non-descriptive language. The aim, then, is to be able to automatically identify descriptive terms in unstructured reviews for later use in product flavor characterization. We created two systems to perform this task. The first is an interactive visual tool that can be used to tag examples of descriptive terms from thousands of whisky reviews. This creates a training dataset that we use to perform transfer learning using GloVe word embeddings and a Long Short-Term Memory deep learning model architecture. The result is a model that can accurately identify descriptors within a corpus of whisky review texts with a train/test accuracy of 99\% and precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.99. We tested for overfitting by comparing the training and validation loss for divergence. Our results show that the language structure for descriptive terms can be programmatically learned.},

  abstract = {GLENN W . MILLIGAN AND MARTHA C. COOPER THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY A Monte Carlo evaluation of 30 procedures for determining the number of clusters was conducted on artificial data sets which contained either 2, 3, 4, or 5 distinct nonoverlapping clusters. To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

  abstract = {Many dietary interventions assume a positive influence of home cooking on diet, health and social outcomes, but evidence remains inconsistent. We aimed to systematically review health and social determinants and outcomes of home cooking. Given the absence of a widely accepted, established definition, we defined home cooking as the actions required for preparing hot or cold foods at home, including combining, mixing and often heating ingredients. Nineteen electronic databases were searched for relevant literature. Peer-reviewed studies in English were included if they focussed mainly on home cooking, and presented post 19th century observational or qualitative data on participants from high/very high human development index countries. Interventional study designs, which have previously been reviewed, were excluded. Themes were summarised using narrative synthesis. From 13,341 unique records, 38 studies e primarily cross-sectional in design e met the inclusion criteria. A conceptual model was developed, mapping determinants of home cooking to layers of influence including non-modifiable, individual, community and cultural factors. Key determinants included female gender, greater time availability and employment, close personal relationships, and culture and ethnic background. Putative outcomes were mostly at an individual level and focused on potential dietary benefits. Findings show that determinants of home cooking are more complex than simply possessing cooking skills, and that potential positive associations between cooking, diet and health require further confirmation. Current evidence is limited by reliance on cross-sectional studies and authors' conceptualisation of determinants and outcomes.},

Connoisseurs are able to identify the origin of a certain number of cheeses, which raises the question of whether one can speak of georegions (terroirs) or specific geographical areas as in the case of wine. A new method of large-scale cartography (agro-pedological units) covering 20 cheese cooperatives provided a statistical comparison showing the different edaphic sectors.

For these initiatives to succeed, it is necessary to know which foods contribute to health and well-being, and which are unhealthy. The present commentary outlines the NOVA system of food classification based on the nature, extent and purpose of food processing. Evidence that NOVA effectively addresses the quality of diets and their impact on all forms of malnutrition, and also the sustainability of food systems, has now accumulated in a number of countries, as shown here. A singular feature of NOVA is its identification of ultra-processed food and drink products. These are not modified foods, but formulations mostly of cheap industrial sources of dietary energy and nutrients plus additives, using a series of processes (hence `ultra-processed'). All together, they are energy-dense, high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt, and poor sources of protein, dietary fibre and micronutrients. Ultra-processed products are made to be hyper-palatable and attractive, with long shelf-life, and able to be consumed anywhere, any time. Their formulation, presentation and marketing often promote overconsumption. Studies based on NOVA show that ultra-processed products now dominate the food supplies of various high-income countries and are increasingly pervasive in lowermiddle- and upper-middle-income countries. The evidence so far shows that displacement of minimally processed foods and freshly prepared dishes and meals by ultra-processed products is associated with unhealthy dietary nutrient profiles and several diet-related non-communicable diseases. Ultra-processed products are also troublesome from social, cultural, economic, political and environmental points of view. We conclude that the ever-increasing production and consumption of these products is a world crisis, to be confronted, checked and reversed as part of the work of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and its Decade of Nutrition.},

To investigate this, Chardonnay grape juice was subjected to two inoculation treatments (uninoculated and pied de cuve inoculation) as well as two SO2 addition concentrations (0 and 40 mg/L). The bacterial communities, fungal communities and Saccharomyces populations were monitored throughout fermentation using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. After fermentation, the wines were evaluated by a panel of experts. When no SO2 was added, the wines underwent alcoholic fermentation and malolactic fermentation simultaneously. Tatumella bacteria were present in significant numbers, but only in the fermentations to which no SO2 was added, and were likely responsible for the malolactic fermentation observed in these treatments. All fermentations were dominated by a genetically diverse indigenous population of Saccharomyces uvarum, the highest diversity of S. uvarum strains to be identified to date; 150 unique strains were identified, with differences in strain composition as a result of SO2 addition. This is the first report of indigenous S. uvarum strains dominating and completing fermentations at a commercial winery in North America.}

In this study, we performed mesoscopic structural measurements\textemdash dynamic light scattering (DLS) and smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS)\textemdash to elucidate the relationship between the liquid structure and flavor maturation of whiskies. Both techniques detected two scattering components corresponding to the clusters formed by the extractives from oak casks during maturation, which are not present in the new make (freshly distilled whisky). Analyzing the scattering profiles revealed that only the small clusters increase in concentration during maturation. It is concluded the small cluster component is crucial for obtaining flavorful whiskies, while the large cluster component, whose concentration is independent of the maturation time, is related to the alcoholic irritation of the whiskies, as demonstrated by the sonication test.},

We find strong evidence that the vintage age (the number of years between the distillation date and the data collection date) positively affects investor asking prices. More precisely, given that the characteristics of whisky, unlike wine, do not change over time once bottled, we disentangle the vintage age effect by subdividing the vintage age into whisky age (the time spent in the cask) and bottle age (the time spent in the bottle). Our results show that whisky age has a more pronounced impact (8.9\% per year on average) than bottle age (6.7\%). Other findings include the significant influence of distillery reputation, with a moderating effect for independent bottling (i.e., not in-house by the distiller itself) and a positive impact for cask strength whiskies compared to diluted ones.

  abstract = {Abstract Background and Aims Some wineries, in order to promote the growth of yeasts able to ferment grape musts, traditionally produce wines using the ?pied de cuve? method. The aim of the present work was to study the performance of fortified pied de cuve (FPdC) prepared by addition of wine. Method and Results Two FPdCs were prepared with the addition of wine at 1.5 and 3\% (v/v) of ethanol to the musts and allowed to spontaneously ferment. The FPdCs were then added to fresh bulk musts in order to accelerate the spontaneous alcoholic fermentation (AF). Interestingly, several Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated during the pied de cuve preparation were detected at the highest concentration throughout AF. The chemical composition of the wines conformed to commercial regulations. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were mainly represented by diethyl succinate and ethyl lactate, as well as by hexanol and isoamyl alcohol. Principal component analysis of the chemical parameters, VOCs and sensory data showed that the use of experimental pied de cuve influenced positively the composition of the final wines. Conclusion The FPdC had no negative impact on the microbiological and chemical composition of wines, but it affected the diversity of the species S.?cerevisiae present during AF and the sensory profile of the final wine. Significance of the Study This study provided evidence that FPdC accelerates spontaneous AF and influences the sensory profile of red wines.},

  abstract = {Individuals differ in the degree to which they attend to different sensory inputs of food when they make their judgments of overall liking. Foods are complex, so it is quite difficult to isolate the effect of any one sensory input without confounding with other sensory inputs. However, analytically one can begin to estimate the importance of a sensory input by the linear slope M, relating overall liking to sensory attribute liking [Overall Liking = M(Attribute Liking) + B]. On an individual-by-individual basis one can compute these slopes for appearance, taste/flavor, and texture, respectively, as well as the normalized slopes (defined as the attribute liking slope divided by the sum of the three attribute liking slopes). The approach is applied to six food product categories: bologna, hot dog, carbonated fruit beverage, blueberry pie filling, peanut butter, salad dressing. The results show substantial inter-individual variability in the way overall liking covaries with sensory attribute liking. On an aggregate basis for foods the rank of importance for attribute liking is taste/flavor, texture, and appearance, respectively. However, on an individual basis there are a variety of different patterns.},

The paper then deals in depth with Internet-based interviews, the evolution of conjoint analysis from text+pictures to purely visual approaches, and the introduction of response time as another dependent variable along side direct ratings. The paper finishes with two new areas. One area is the assessment of pair-wise interactions and their magnitude, a topic that is easy to do in response surface analysis but difficult to do in studies where the variables are `absent/present'. The second area comprises the integrated databases using linked conjoint analyses, with extensive classification questionnaires. This approach, stimulated by the genomics revolution, aims to create a multi-faceted snapshot of a large-scale category, such as beverages, across products and over time.},

In this context four profiling methods; sorting, projective mapping, flash profile and repertory grid method (RGM) were explored among target consumers of hot beverages in two European countries (UK and France) with the assumption that meaningful sensory descriptors can be generated and quantified, and that product maps can ultimately be drawn. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also performed with a trained panel and its outcomes were used as a basis for comparison. Results showed that consumers were able to describe and quantify product differences, that their perception was similar on a cross-country level, that trained panel maps translated well consumers' description, and that flash profiling and RGM were more suitable for such a task as they generate a rich vocabulary and more accurate maps. However, when describing complex attributes as mouthfeel or afterfeel, the consumers' description was not enough detailed or not consensual.},

In this process, discourses of science and quantification create rational and ethical reasons to drink wine. In the process of quantification, wine is defined as a medicalized component of a healthy diet, and those who drink wine become medicalized patients. Knowing the line between "moderate" and "excessive" drinking becomes a mathematical calculation, and this calculation determines whether or not one is healthy. Such a move normalizes a scientific attitude toward public life by making the restrained, rational and numerate drinker into the "healthy" and ethical drinker.

The application of a latent class choice model allowed the analysis of how strongly individual consumers differed in their reaction to back label information. Five distinct segments emerged from the overall sample with significant differences found for the relative importance of back label statements along with price, price sensitivity, and the acceptance of an ingredient list on the back label. Overall winery history, elaborate taste descriptions and food pairing were found to be the most highly valued back label statements, while ingredient information had a large negative impact on one segment in particular.},

This approach simulated the process of a consumer choosing a product from the shelf, tasting the product, and making a repurchase decision. The response measures were validated by relating them to market sales data. Twenty-one commercial Australian Shiraz red wines were characterised by a trained sensory panel. Four hundred and twenty-six regular wine consumers chose a wine for a dinner with friends from simulated shelves of the wines represented by photographs. Their choices were mainly a result of extrinsic wine attributes and the frequency of choice was found to be highly related to a wine's market share. The same consumers evaluated liking and made a repurchase decision in a central location tasting in an incomplete design, which included photos of each of the 21 wines. Price was found to be a strong positive driver of informed liking, and liking did not relate to the sales volume or to the initial choice in the online experiment. In contrast, the previously measured online choice was a strong predictor for repurchase with tasting, confirming that both product expectations at the initial purchase and intrinsic sensory attributes during product consumption substantially influence the repurchase decision. A number of common sensory characteristics were also positively and negatively related to both liking and repurchase intent. The study provided an insight into the relative importance of product expectation and actual sensory experience on informed repurchase intent. The combination of the discrete choice methodology with sensory descriptive data and consumer sensory testing shows promise.},

This study separated the relative effect of various attributes and also considers differences between consumers in their responsiveness to various product cues. Five-hundred and twenty-one regular wine consumers participated in a central location test in three German cities in 2005. Respondents first rated hedonic liking of a white wine in a blind condition, then evaluated elements of product concepts differing in four extrinsic attributes, region of origin, grape variety, brand and packaging style, before indicating their liking and purchase intent in an informed condition. Overall, label style and brand evaluation were the strongest drivers for informed liking followed by liking in the blind condition. Purchase intent was influenced directly only by informed liking and price evaluation; the effect of the extrinsic and intrinsic cues is mediated through informed liking. A latent class regression resulted in three consumer segments that differ in the responsiveness of their informed liking to the different product characteristics. Younger inexperienced consumers utilised a mix of various cues, wine experienced consumers based their evaluation mainly on grape variety and blind hedonic liking, and older frequent wine consumers were influenced most strongly by brand and packaging. These findings provide insights into the relative impact of product packaging, branding and labelling on overall product liking and indicate strong differences in how consumers respond to different product characteristics.},

Hunger and fullness sensations were described as having both physical and psychological components that were divided into two groups: typical and extreme. Overall, hunger was described as the presence of stomach growls, stomach hunger pains, emptiness, focus on eating, loss of energy, and desire to eat. Fullness was described as a feeling of food in the stomach, stomach stretch, satisfaction, contentment, energized, focused, and lack of the desire to eat. Typical fullness was described with many psychological components while typical hunger was primarily physical in nature. Participants described situations where sensations of mental hunger and physical fullness overlapped, which provided evidence that the overall constructs of hunger and fullness may not be simple, polar opposites.},

Their practices constitute an important modality of resistance to dominant modes of living with data, an approach that we call ``soft resistance.'' Soft resistance happens when participants assume multiple roles as project designers, data collectors, and critical sense-makers who rapidly shift priorities. This constant shifting keeps data sets fragmented and thus creates material resistance to traditional modes of data aggregation. It also breaks the categories that make traditional aggregations appear authoritative. This enables participants to partially yet significantly escape the frames created by the biopolitics of the health technology industry.},

  abstract = {The analysis and visualization of weighted networks pose many challenges, which have led to the development of techniques for extracting the network's backbone, a subgraph composed of only the most significant edges. Weighted edges are particularly common in bipartite projections (e.g. networks of coauthorship, co-attendance, co-sponsorship), which are often used as proxies for one-mode networks where direct measurement is impractical or impossible (e.g. networks of collaboration, friendship, alliance). However, extracting the backbone of bipartite projections requires special care. This paper reviews existing methods for extracting the backbone from bipartite projections, and proposes a new method that aims to overcome their limitations. The stochastic degree sequence model (SDSM) involves the construction of empirical edge weight distributions from random bipartite networks with stochastic marginals, and is demonstrated using data on bill sponsorship in the 108th U.S. Senate. The extracted backbone's validity as a network reflecting political alliances and antagonisms is established through comparisons with data on political party affiliations and political ideologies, which offer an empirical ground-truth. The projection and backbone extraction methods discussed in this paper can be performed using the -onemode- command in Stata.},

This design is utilized to imitate a more realistic shopping scenario for consumers when choosing among many different products simultaneously. This approach allows participants to choose both multiple items, in this case vegetables, and related quantities/expenditures to place in a basket of goods. We provide an application of the experimental design to a vegetable choice experiment. This is done in conjunction with a sensory experiment to provide a contextual component to the experiment and econometric model. This type of experiment lends itself to the use of the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) class of models. More specifically, we use the extended version of the MDCEV model proposed by Palma and Hess (2020) that relaxes the need for a budget while also accounting for substitution and complementarity among products. We find that the proposed design and class of econometric methods present a flexible way to analyze consumer choice when the desire is to elicit preferences for a basket of goods rather than simple discrete alternatives or attributes.},

Sorting is a form of nominal level measurement in that a pair of products is either placed in the same category or not for each subject. Analysis of projective mapping data is typically performed with multiple factor analysis, and sorting is typically performed with multidimensional scaling (MDS). This study took an exploratory empirical look at apple and cheese product systems separately in a direct comparison of sorting (analyzed by MDS) with projective mapping (analyzed with MFA). Product maps were similar for both the sorting and projective mapping procedures. Subjects had more difficulty with the apples than the cheeses. Cluster analysis was easier to interpret for the napping configurations.},

This study extended the previous findings to group data, and in a different product system, namely pizza toppings. Purchase intent responses to pairs of 25 different pizza toppings were collected and used to predict pizzas (with 1\textendash 6 toppings) that would appeal to the entire group. Results showed purchase interest to be higher for the predicted pizzas than for non-predicted pizzas supporting the supercombinatorality principle.

One such emotion profile, the EsSense Profile\`O (King \& Meiselman, 2010) contains 39 emotions and has had increased use in product research. One of the practical challenges to its wider adoption is the length of the profile. We present results from 4 sets of studies designed to evaluate the semantic structure of the EsSense Profile\`O, to develop a shorter version of it, and to validate the shorter version, both conceptually and practically. A sorting methodology was used to sort the 39 EsSense Profile\`O emotions (printed on cards) into groups based on a similarity criterion, using two subject populations (n = 121). A unique modification was implemented where subjects indicated from each sorted pile which word in that pile best described the sorted group. Hierarchical clustering was used to highlight the structure, and candidate words for removal were chosen, reducing the list to 25 words. Using both the EsSense Profile\`O and EsSense25 lists, a validation sorting study was performed (n = 87). Confirmation studies conducted online (n = 1728) and in CLTs (n = 306) used the questionnaires in real-world scenarios, including food-name evaluations, brand evaluations and product tasting. Overall both lists performed similarly, but analyses revealed that there may be important context effects in which the meaning of words may change across product categories and across emotion lists. We finish with a discussion of why this might be and what this means to the sensory practitioner.},

Data collected in a sensory laboratory is likely to have little predictive value of consumer experience in real-life situations. This study determined the effects of context on consumer response to two commercial beers. Regular beer consumers (n = 100) rated liking and emotional response using ten beer-specific emotion categories for two beers (Lager and Ale) under three different conditions: (1) a sensory testing facility (Lab), (2) a natural consumption environment (Bar) and (3) using an evoked context (Evoked). Their choice of product to take home was also recorded. Overall results showed significant product differentiation for liking (F (99, 2, 1) = 8.46, p = 0.004) and product choice (Q (1, N = 100) = 4.85, p = 0.028) in the Bar but not in the Lab or Evoked context. Emotional variables highlighted significant product differentiation (p {$<$} 0.05) but more so in the Bar than in the Lab or Evoked context. However, clustering participants on liking revealed three distinct clusters differing in sensitivity to context. Two clusters showed opposing but consistent preference for one of the two products regardless of context. The third cluster was more influenced by context, showing a more discriminating response in the Bar. These findings showed that consumers differ in their degree of context-sensitivity and the extent to which evoking a context gives similar results to a real environment. They also highlighted the importance of segmentation and confirmed the added insights gained by measuring emotional response compared to liking.},

  abstract = {Veganism is an increasingly popular identity within Western societies, including Australia. However, there appears to be a positivist approach to defining veganism in the literature. This has implications for measurement and coherence of the research literature. This exploratory study assessed preference rankings for definitions of veganism used by vegan advocacy groups across an Australian convenience sample of three dietary groups (vegan~=~230, omnivore~=~117, vegetarian~=~43). Participants were also asked to explain their ranking order in an open-ended question. Most vegans selected the UK definition as their first preference, omnivores underwent five rounds of preference reallocation before the Irish definition was selected, and vegetarians underwent four rounds before the UK definition was selected. A reflexive thematic analysis of participant explanations for their rankings identified four themes: (1) Diet vs. lifestyle, (2) Absolutism, (3) Social justice, and (4) Animal justice. These four themes represent how participants had differing perceptions of veganism according to their personal experience and understanding of the term. It appears participants took less of an absolutist approach to the definition and how individuals conceptualise veganism may be more dynamic than first expected. This will be important when researchers consider how veganism is defined in future studies to maintain consistency in the field.},

With a primarily American focus, we document striking paucity of basic research in SES, review the history of SES measurement, highlight the central limitations of current measurement approaches, sketch a new theoretical perspective, present new pilot results, and outline areas for future research. We argue (1) that lack of conceptual clarity and the bypassing of standard psychometric techniques have retarded SES measurement. And (2) social epidemiologists should revisit the measurement of SES and consider whether a richer, psychometrically induced, approach would be more useful. Our pilot study suggests a great deal of uniformity between existing SES measures and that a new approach may be worthy of pursuit. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Parental food involvement \textendash{} the level of importance of food in a person's life \textendash{} may be one of many important factors. The aim of this study was to determine whether parental food involvement is associated with parents' and children's diet quality. As part of an intervention study, 394 parents with children aged between 18 months and 5 years were recruited from children's centres in Cornwall and Islington, UK. Questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, parents' diets, and attitudes towards food including food involvement. Children's diets were assessed using the multiple pass 24 h recall method. Parents reported low intakes of fruits and vegetables and high intakes of sugary items for themselves and their young children. Parental food involvement was strongly correlated with consumption of fruits and vegetables (amount and diversity) for both parents and children. Correlations with consumption of sugary drinks and snacks/foods were not significant. These findings indicate that parental food involvement may influence consumption of fruits and vegetables, more so than sugary items. Further research is needed to investigate how parental food involvement could mediate dietary changes.},

Specifically, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hilbert\textendash Schmidt matrix S may be used to obtain a geometrical representation of the studies.

The matrix S can be expressed as the sum of a rank 1 matrix {$\lambda$} uu T with an error matrix E . Therefore, the components of the vector {$\lambda$} u are sufficient to locate the points associated to the studies. Former models for S where vec ( E ) are mathematically tractable and yet do not take into account the symmetry of the matrix S . Thus a new symmetric model is proposed as well as the corresponding tests for a common structure. It is further shown how to assess the goodness of fit of such models.

Thus, internationally bred strawberries grown in Australia will have a flavor profile adapted to the Australian environment.

A quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) trained panel developed a lexicon consisting of two appearance, eight aroma, ten flavor, and five textural/mouthfeel attributes to describe the strawberries. The panel subsequently applied the developed lexicon to describe the sensory attributes of six strawberry cultivars of two flowering types, grown in Australia and harvested at two different maturation stages. A principal component analysis (PCA) determined three dimensions of which the attributes explained 86\% of the variance. There were significant differences identified between strawberries, attributable to flowering type, cultivar and maturation stage, validating the developed lexicon to discriminate strawberries.},

The aim of this research is to compare the results obtained from DA to those established via CATA using untrained consumers, and to assess any differences in attributes identified to drive liking. Trained panelists (n 5 12, minimum 60 hr each panelist) and untrained consumers (n 5 131) were provided with six strawberry samples (three duplicate cultivars). The trained panel applied DA techniques to profile each strawberry cultivar, and the untrained consumer panel used CATA to select all attributes applying to each sample. A second untrained consumer panel (n 5 139) rated their liking of the same sample set on a hedonic general labeled magnitude scale. Results revealed CATA produced moderately comparable product configurations to DA (RV coefficient 5 0.760), with similarities in descriptors associated with liking. This research has established CATA as a time and cost-efficient alternative for the DA methodology, however, when precise definitions and subsequent quantification of the sensory attributes of products are required, DA is a more robust and reliable evaluation tool.},

Four hypotheses are stated and tested on orange juice data from Norway. A trained sensory panel and consumers (n = 105) evaluated six juice samples that vary according to three factors. These factors were (1) Brand (PL and NB), (2) Treatment (Gentle heat treatment and Pasteurized) and (3) Pulp (with and without). Principal component analysis, two-way ANOVA, and PLS regression were conducted, and the results indicate that variation in quality exists both among PL and NB, there is a large discrepancy between blind liking and brand choice, and that consumers with a positive attitude towards PL are more likely to choose a PL instead of a NB.},

However, navigating these massive worlds and finding topics of specific interest often proves difficult because the worlds are mostly organized haphazardly, leaving users to find relevant interests by word of mouth or using a basic search feature. Here, we report on a method using the backbone of a network to create a map of the primary topics of interest in any social network. To demonstrate the method, we build an interest map for the social news web site reddit and show how such a map could be used to navigate a social media world. Moreover, we analyze the network properties of the reddit social network and find that it has a scale-free, small-world, and modular community structure, much like other online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We suggest that the integration of interest maps into popular social media platforms will assist users in organizing themselves into more specific interest groups, which will help alleviate the overcrowding effect often observed in large online communities.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces SensoGraph, a novel approach for fast sensory evaluation using two-dimensional geometric techniques. In the tasting sessions, the assessors follow their own criteria to place samples on a tablecloth, according to the similarity between samples. In order to analyse the data collected, first a geometric clustering is performed to each tablecloth, extracting connections between the samples. Then, these connections are used to construct a global similarity matrix. Finally, a graph drawing algorithm is used to obtain a 2D consensus graphic, which reflects the global opinion of the panel by (1) positioning closer those samples that have been globally perceived as similar and (2) showing the strength of the connections between samples. The proposal is validated by performing four tasting sessions, with three types of panels tasting different wines, and by developing a new software to implement the proposed techniques. The results obtained show that the graphics provide similar positionings of the samples as the consensus maps obtained by multiple factor analysis (MFA), further providing extra information about connections between samples, not present in any previous method. The main conclusion is that the use of geometric techniques provides information complementary to MFA, and of a different type. Finally, the method proposed is computationally able to manage a significantly larger number of assessors than MFA, which can be useful for the comparison of pictures by a huge number of consumers, via the Internet.},

Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor.

Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired. Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

To answer this question, several laboratories carried out in parallel the sensory profiles of two sets of products. The results have been studied according to two points of view, one-dimensional and multidimensional. An analysis of variance has been carried out for each attribute in each laboratory and we have compared the significances of the coefficients of the product effects of two laboratories. A multiple factor analysis is performed to compare the multidimensional approaches by laboratory. The data show a great multidimensional stability in spite of some divergences for some products and some attributes. This important data file gives the opportunity to have an idea of the frequency of the following effects' significance: the order effect, the session effect, and the interaction between product and session during the tasting with a trained jury. Moreover, it gives the opportunity to enrich the discussion about the statute (fixed or random) of the assessor factor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volunteers participated in four sessions at lunch time. In the no-choice/no-variety condition, volunteers were served one dish randomly selected from among the three. In the no-choice/variety condition, volunteers were served all three dishes. In the choice/no-variety condition, participants chose one dish from among the three dishes. In the choice/variety condition, volunteers chose as many dishes as they desired from among the three dishes. Results showed that providing choice increased vegetable liking and vegetable intake, while offering a variety of vegetables only increased their liking. No synergy effect between choice and variety was observed on vegetable liking and vegetable intake (i.e. the effect in the choice/variety condition was not significantly higher than the effects in no-choice/variety and the choice/no-variety conditions).},

Eleven wine experts and 11 wine novices participated in tasks measuring olfactory threshold, odour recognition, odour identification, and consistency of odour naming. Twenty-four wine-relevant odorants were sampled orthonasally by each participant in the semantic (identification; consistency of naming) and episodic (recognition) memory tasks. Results showed superior olfactory recognition by expert wine judges, despite their olfactory sensitivity and bias measures being similar to those of novices. Contrary to predictions based on reports of an association between odour memory and semantic processing, wine experts did not perform better than novices on the verbal memory tasks. Further, ability to recognize odours and ability to name odours were not positively correlated, although the novices' data showed a trend in this direction. The results imply that the source of superior odour recognition in wine experts was not enhanced semantic memory and linguistic capabilities for wine-relevant odours. One interpretation of the data is that wine experts were less susceptible than wine novices to verbal overshadowing. When forced to identify the odorants, experts' superior perceptual skills protected them from verbal interference, whereas novices' generated verbal representations of the odours were emphasized at the expense of the odorant itself. This has implications for training in wine-evaluation skills.},

  abstract = {The distinctive New Zealand wine style ``Marlborough Sauvignon blanc'' was investigated by sensory characterisation, by judgments of typicality, and by chemical analysis of selected aroma compounds. Typicality was defined in terms of perceived representativeness where good examples of the concept were considered more typical. Wine professionals undertook three sorting tasks and a descriptive rating task involving 15 Sauvignon blanc wines from New Zealand and France. Ortho-nasal and global (retronasal and taste) data were each considered. Wines were sorted into experimenter-provided categories of ``green'' or ``not green'', ``ripe'' or ``not ripe'', and ``good varietal definition'' or ``not good varietal definition''. To elucidate the critical components of representativeness, typicality ratings for each wine were considered in relation to descriptive ratings of specific flavours, to the sensory data from the three sorting tasks, and in relation to the concentrations of two aroma compounds, namely 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) and 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IPMP). Results demonstrated that wines considered to have good varietal definition were also rated higher on typicality with respect to Marlborough Sauvignon blanc than wines that were judged to be lower in varietal characteristics. The data also showed that the higher-order flavour concepts of Green and Ripe were mutually exclusive but each was essential to the concept of a typical Marlborough Sauvignon blanc. Specific flavour characteristics (e.g., green capsicum; boxwood) were predictive of high typicality ratings for a wine, whilst others (e.g., mineral) were predictive of low typicality ratings. The chemical concentrations of IBMP and IPMP correlated positively with perceived green flavours, and inversely with perceived ripe and fruity flavours. The data are interpreted within a cognitive model of conceptual structure [Rosch, E., \& Mervis, C. (1975). Family resemblances: Studies in the internal structure of categories. Cognitive Psychology, 7, 573\textendash 605] that considers not only the ideal or prototypical Marlborough Sauvignon blanc but also the limits to the variability in flavour profile that can be tolerated by experienced wine professionals for a wine to be perceived as typical of its style.},

In the present study, Sauvignon blanc wines from sub-regions of Marlborough, New Zealand, and from north France (Sancerre, Loire, and Saint Bris) were investigated in terms of (i) distinctiveness of country of origin, (ii) odour profile, and (iii) the concept of typicality (Ballester, J., Dacremont, C., Le Fur, Y., \& Etievant, P. (2005). The role of olfaction in the elaboration and use of the Chardonnay wine concept. Food Quality and Preference, 16, 351\textendash 359). Twenty-three experienced French wine tasters (12 Oenology students and 11 Flavour Panellists), with no prior experience of Marlborough Sauvignon blanc wine, evaluated six French and six Marlborough Sauvignon blanc wines by ortho-nasal olfaction. A range of tasks was employed including descriptive profiling and sorting into categories based on origin of wine. The data were subjected to multivariate analyses. Principal components analysis of descriptive data showed that (i) wines were separable by country of origin (NZ or France), and (ii) clear sub-regional differences in perceived odour profile were reported for French wines, and to a lesser degree for New Zealand wines. Overall, New Zealand wines were evaluated as showing higher levels of both fruity (e.g., passionfruit) and fresh green notes (e.g., green capsicum), while French wines were judged higher on dried herbaceous characters and mineral/flinty notes. Contrary to expectation, the French participants rated New Zealand wines higher on the concept of typicality and higher on appreciation than the French wines. The results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing relevant to conceptualisation of wine typicality.},

Thirty-nine wine professionals and 30 wine consumers participated in interviews aimed at inducing verbal responses concerning their representations of (i) wine complexity in general, (ii) wine complexity in relation to white wine with perceived aging ability, and (iii) wine complexity in relation to red wine with perceived aging ability. The verbal data were analysed with the textual data analysis software ALCESTE (Reinert, 1983; 1986; 2001, 2008). Results showed that wine professionals as a group tended to represent complexity in wine in terms of extrinsic factors such as oenological processes (e.g., lees stirring; use of oak) and terroir variables (e.g., soil; viticulture: See Moran, 2006). On the other hand, wine consumers' representations of wine complexity were dominated by intrinsic factors relating to their experience of consuming wine (e.g., smell and taste of wines) and were personalised and subjective (e.g., about their own enjoyment and pleasure). Further, wine professionals' representations clearly differentiated between characteristics of white wine with aging potential and characteristics of red wine with aging potential whereas those of wine consumers did not. The results are discussed in terms of the salient components of the concept of complexity in wine, including wine judged to have aging ability, along with the cognitive processing associated with wine expertise.},

This article offers a theoretical frame for understanding the recent rise in American artisan raw-milk cheese production, as well as wider debates over food localism, nutrition, and safety. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with cheese makers and purveyors and on participant-labor conducted on a Vermont sheep dairy farm, I develop the concept of microbiopolitics to analyze how farmer-cheese makers, industry consultants, retailers, and consumers negotiate Pasteurian (hygienic) and post-Pasteurian (probiotic) attitudes about the microbial agents at the heart of raw-milk cheese and controversies about this nature-culture hybrid.},

In this study, the temperature effect during apple wine making on both the key aroma compounds and sensory properties of apple wine were investigated. The concentration of nine key aroma compounds (ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, isopentylacetate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl 4-hydroxybutanoate, isobutylalcohol, isopentylalcohol, 3-methylthio-1propanol, and benzeneethanol) in apple wine significantly increased with the increase of fermentation temperature from 17 to 20 \textdegree C, and then eight out of the nine key aroma compounds with an exception of ethyl 4-hydroxybutanoate, decreased when the temperature goes up 20 to 26 \textdegree C. Sensory analysis showed that the apple wine fermented at 20 \textdegree C had the highest acceptance for consumers. Fermentation at the temperature of 20 \textdegree C was therefore considered to be the most suitable condition using the selected yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae AP05) for apple wine making. Changes in the fermentation temperature can considerably affect the production of key aroma compounds and sensory profiles of apple wine. These results could help apple wine producers make better quality production for consumers at the optimal fermentation temperature.},

All this poses the problem of methods and strategies for studying/optimising the overall quality of food products. Two approaches are presented: (a) pyramiding by comparing pairs of antithetic consumer requirements, and (b) minimizing rejection as a more useful approach than maximizing preferences. It is suggested that sensory science be considered as the ``science of quality perception''.},

This study compares wine characterizations obtained through free profiling by wine professionals with conventional profiling by a panel of trained judges.

Free profiling may be a good compromise to obtain meaningful results from untrained but knowledgeable wine professionals.},

This method was applied using 14 wine experts, who evaluated 10 red wines twice. The independent analysis of the words thus obtained is interpretable and rich of information. The comparison with the characterization obtained from an independent classical profiling both supports the results of the UFP and shows the specific contribution of this method. Moreover, the minimal quotation frequency from which the items were introduced in the analysis is discussed. In the present example, the robustness observed whatever the threshold selected is an argument in favor of the stability of this method.},

This methodology was applied to two different sets of appellations (white wines and red wines sets) from the Central Loire Valley region in France. The results obtained differed according to the product space studied: an agreement between the typicality judgments was only observed for the red wines product space. The appellation and typicality constituted strong elements in the red wine space structure and it was possible to translate typicality of the red wines product space in terms of sensory characteristics.},

Both studies investigated sensory satiation by measuring ad libitum intake of a tomato soup model. The Aroma study varied aroma concentration and aroma duration as the explanatory variables, and the Taste study varied salt intensity. To combine the data from the two studies, the Aroma study needed information on salt aspects for all of its observations. Equally, the Taste study needed information on aroma aspects. This information was used to link the two single networks, each representing one study, into a combined network; therefore, it is referred to as structural linking information. The approach taken is seen as an example for the potential benefit and the challenges when combining raw datasets from different studies. The combined network is able to generate additional insights into complex relationships encountered with research on satiation. The main challenge results from the missing of structural linking information. In this paper, we (1) suggest solutions for obtaining the structural linking information, and (2) propose an approach to global experimental design to prevent this situation. The nature of the paper is theoretical rather than analytical due to the limitations caused by the small size of datasets.},

  abstract = {In the United States, the market for ``hard'' (alcoholic) ciders is growing rapidly, with over \$1 billion USD in sales in 2018. These ciders present a broad range of sensory profiles, especially for smallproduction ciders from craft and local cideries, which represent at least 25\% of the market. Unfortunately, the sensory profiles that characterize craft ciders are not well-defined in comparison to wine and beer. The cider industry and small, local craft cideries in particular could benefit from a uniform language to identify sensory attributes that are desirable (or undesirable) among their products\textemdash this study explores the feasibility and utility of one such descriptive lexicon. For lexicon development, a first group of panelists (N1 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 28) smelled and tasted Virginia ciders (K1 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6) and described, in their own words, their impressions of each cider. These open-ended comments were analyzed using classical text analysis to generate 26 sensory attributes for the Check-All-ThatApply (CATA) lexicon. A second group of subjects (N2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 56) smelled and tasted a second set of Virginia ciders (K2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6) for the CATA validation; subjects rated overall liking (9-point hedonic scale) and selected CATA attributes for each sample. Twenty-one of the CATA attributes discriminated among the samples, correspondence analysis (CA) indicated that the attributes adequately spanned the sensory space for Virginia ciders, and penalty-lift analysis revealed attributes that were associated with consumer liking. This study demonstrates that a uniform descriptive language like a CATA can be used to describe hard cider and can be linked to consumer liking.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the association between traditional food consumption and motives for food choice in six European countries. Cross-sectional data were collected through the TRUEFOOD panEuropean consumer survey (n = 4828) with samples representative for age, gender and region in Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Poland and Spain. Importance attached to familiarity with a product is found to be strongly and positively associated with general attitude toward traditional food as well as traditional food consumption. The importance attached to convenience was negatively related to both general attitude toward traditional food and traditional food consumption, while the importance of weight control negatively influenced the general attitude. Natural content of food was positively associated with the attitude toward traditional food and traditional food consumption. The importance of price when purchasing food failed to be significantly related with general attitude and traditional food consumption both for the pooled sample as well as within each country except in Spain. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of factors shaping the image and influencing the consumption of traditional foods in Europe. General attitude toward traditional foods, familiarity, and importance of food naturalness emerged as drivers for traditional food consumption. Importance attached to convenience and health acted as direct barriers to traditional food consumption, whereas importance of weight control emerged as an indirect barrier through lowering general attitude toward traditional foods.},

  abstract = {Complexity is a relevant dimension in the development of products preferences and acceptability because of its relationship with hedonic appreciation. The present study aimed to investigate the individual differences in the relationships between product complexity in alcoholic cocktails to liking and to specific sensory properties, situational appropriateness and emotional responses. Six alcoholic cocktails, all of them composed by a common bitter ingredient were selected to represent different complexity levels based on alcohol content, number of ingredients and differences in sensory properties. Products were evaluated by a consumer panel using consumerled product specific questionnaires. At panel level, the perceived complexity was found to be aligned with the hypothesized range of complexity. When two clusters of consumers based on individual differences in complexity ratings were considered, we observed different relationships between complexity and liking as compared to panel level. Furthermore, the sensory, emotional and situational appropriateness drivers of complexity differed in the two clusters. These data showed that perceived complexity is a multi-dimensional construct in which individuals showing high familiarity with cocktails based on bitter are found to have a very high variation in complexity perception due to a difference in conceptualization of this product dimension compared to individuals with a lower familiarity.},

Choice of sensory method and testing environment should be considered here. Good quality data means data that are a good reJlection of some true value and have little associated uncertainty; that is accuracy and precision. Many of the practical questions that arise when designing sensory measurements affect these aspects, such as the number and type of assessors, frequency or amount of testing, sample presentation and sample order Economical experimentation means choosing the most efJicient design, and will often conflict with getting the best quality data.},

In three separate studies we extended this line of research by: (1) replicating these previous findings with consumers from another country and another product category; (2) investigating the impact of participants' product consumption frequency on their associative emotional responses; and (3) examining whether the emotional associations involved in eating certain products in evoked contexts are stable through time. The results of this work support previous findings demonstrating the impact of the consumption context (and its perceived appropriateness) on consumers' reported emotional associations with a food product, and that this result is generalizable across nationalities. We also confirm that the associative emotion profiles of more emotion-laden product categories (in comparison with more neutral ones; e.g. chocolate vs. fruit) are more variable between contexts. In addition, the emotional associative profiles obtained from two groups of participants that were either high or low frequent consumers of the food stimuli did not differ to any significant extent. Finally, the emotion responses provided under evoked consumption contexts seemed to be consistent (stable) across time. Taken together, this study strengthens the rationale for evoking consumption contexts during emotion-related tasks, demonstrating that this methodology provides repeatable results and insights that go beyond the product and the consumer.},

However, just how strong is the evidence in support of this claim, and what are the underlying mechanisms? It has been shown that not only the colour itself, but also the variety and the arrangement of the differently-coloured components in a meal influence consumers' ratings of the pleasantness of a meal (across time) and, to a certain extent, might even affect their consumption behaviour as well. Typically, eating the same food constantly or repeatedly leads to a decrease in its perceived pleasantness, which, as a consequence, might lead to decreased intake of that food. However, variation within a meal (in one or several sensory attributes, or holistically) has been shown to slow down this process. In this review, we first briefly summarize the literature on how general variety in a meal influences these variables and the major theories that have been put forward by researchers to explain them. We then go on to evaluate the evidence of these effects based mainly on the colour of the food explaining the different processes that might affect colourbased sensory-specific satiety and, in more detail, consumption behaviour. In addition, we also discuss the overlap in the definitions of these terms and provide additional hypothesis as to why, in some cases, the opposite pattern of results has been observed.},

We tested this hypothesis by scanning human subjects using functional MRI while they tasted wines that, contrary to reality, they believed to be different and sold at different prices. Our results show that increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area that is widely thought to encode for experienced pleasantness during experiential tasks. The paper provides evidence for the ability of marketing actions to modulate neural correlates of experienced pleasantness and for the mechanisms through which the effect operates.},

The package is using likelihood principles and is utilizing newer developments within Automatic Differentiation by means of the Template Model Builder R-package. We compare such formal likelihood based analysis with the Mixed Assessor Model (MAM) analysis, where MAM is a linear approximation of the multiplicative mixed model. We use real sensory data as examples together with simulated data. We found that the formal mumm approach for hypothesis testing more resembles the MAM than the standard 2-way mixed model, and that both the mumm approach and the MAM give a higher power to detect product differences than the 2-way mixed model, when a ``scaling effect'' is present. We also validated that the novel contrast confidence limit method suggested previously for the MAM performs well and in line with the formal likelihood based confidence intervals of the mumm. Finally, the likelihood based mumm approach suggests that the more proper test for product difference would be a test that has a ``joint product and scaling effect'' interpretation.},

Three different rye breads were evaluated for liking and their sensory profiles were determined. The consumer groups' values, food choice motives measured with the Food Choice Questionnaire and a Concern scale, and liking of the breads differed significantly according to the analysis of variance and a partial least squares regression analysis. For hedonistic consumers, rye bread characterized by a soft and porous texture influenced liking positively, and food choice motives ``mood'' and ``price'' correlated positively with their values. Traditional consumers were more positive toward different types of rye bread, and food choice motives ``natural content'', ``familiarity'' and ``health concern'' were more important to them than to hedonists. Overall, this study demonstrated that values are connected to food choice motives and, to some extent liking and, thus, values can be utilized both in product development and in advertising.},

  abstract = {Dense subgraphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. Computing them however is generally expensive. We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn2) and space O(n2) in the worst case, and in time O(n2 log n) and space O(n2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

The analysis shows how cultural descriptions are both a resource and a constraint when they must orient a practical activity which must be publicly acknowledged for its cultural typicality. Discrepancies are highlighted between cultural descriptions and ordinary practices, but it is also shown how culture (or ,\"A\`ocultural preferences,\"A\^o) gets produced, at a less explicit level, within discursive practices, through turn-taking filtering, sequential architecture and selection of differentiated addressees. The socializing import of the discursive situation for the younger participants is also discussed, with reference to the relevant conversational devices.},

Nowadays, customers can enter reviews on many websites. The vast number of textual reviews make it difficult for customers or businesses to read directly.

In this paper, we propose to analyze textual reviews using a recently developed topic modeling method called hierarchical latent tree analysis, which has been shown to produce topic hierarchy better than some state-of-the-art topic modeling methods. We test the method using textual reviews written about restaurants on the Yelp website. We show that the topic hierarchy reveals useful insights about the reviews. We further show how to find interesting topics specific to locations.},

The original and modified questionnaires yielded comparable results for different shampoos. Results of characterizing various product categories with the new questionnaire indicated that it is relevant to differentiate the feelings evoked by odors from fragranced and flavored products, which can be perceptually distinct or similar.

The product of interest was an aperitif drink, a ``Kir'' (a traditional French alcoholic aperitif made of white wine with fruit liquor), which was presented to participants in an experimental restaurant, after which participants had a three-course dinner. The specific influence of the Kir on affective responses was studied in relation to its fruit liquor composition: apricot, grapefruit, and raspberry. Two approaches were used to measure self-reported affective responses, each involving a different questionnaire. The first approach was related to the measure of immediate feelings by using the ScentMove\`O questionnaire while participants were consuming their aperitif. Results showed that the three Kir variants were not discriminated. The second approach consisted of measuring mood change across the whole dinner experience, before the aperitif, after the aperitif, and after the dinner, by using the Visual Analog Mood Scales (VAMS). Results showed that the raspberry Kir variant was associated with a significant decrease in two negative mood attributes, tense and anxious, after the participants had the aperitif, as compared with their initial mood state assessed before the aperitif. This study demonstrates therefore that mood state changes can be measured in a natural environment and highlights that these changes are product dependent, the most familiar Kir variant being associated with a greater decrease in negative mood states. However, considering the lack of Kir variant discrimination while participants consumed their aperitif and considering the limited longterm moods' changes across the dinner, this study also emphasizes and discusses the limits of the measures of emotion in ecological settings. Finally, it is suggested to conduct more studies, which compare the measure of self-reported affective feelings in both laboratory settings and ecological settings.},

A comparison was made between overall liking ratings of a tea drink, made with (analytical) or without (synthetic) the anticipation of subsequent attribute ratings.

In a simulation study, artificial data generated either by a plane or by a tree were scaled using procedures for fitting either a plane (KYST) or a tree (ADDTREE). As expected, the appropriate model fit the data better than the inappropriate model for all noise levels. Furthermore, the two models were roughly comparable: for all noise levels, KYST accounted for plane data about as well as ADDTREE accounted for tree data. Two properties of the data proved useful in distinguishing between the models: the skewness of the distribution of distances, and the proportion of elongated triangles, which measures departures from the ultrametric inequality, Applications of KYST and ADDTREE to some twenty sets of real data, collected by other investigators, showed that most of these data could be classified clearly as favoring either a tree or a two-dimensional representation.},

The flavor properties were established by sensory profiling and analysis of volatile and non-volatile components, including titratable acidity, pH, residual sugars and organic acids. A total of 72 volatile compounds were identified in the 14 apple ciders using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) coupled to gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main volatile compounds found in apple ciders were esters and higher alcohols, followed by aldehydes and fatty acids. Sensory characterizations of the aroma and taste of apple ciders were carried out by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis with 23 sensory attributes. The attributes apple, cooked apple, yeasty, sweet and sour were the most predominant sensory descriptors used to describe the similarities and differences in the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that floral and fruity (fresh apple, banana and pear) odors were highly associated with sweet taste and opposed to the more complex aroma attributes (yeasty, lactic, chemical, mouldy, black pepper and earthy) and sour taste. Most of the UK apple ciders were characterized by these complex odors and taste notes sour, astringent and bitter, whereas ciders from the Scandinavian region had diverse sensory profiles. Partial least squares regression (PLS) based on the sensory and chemical data was able to cluster the ciders according to differences in production methods (oak-aged or spontaneous fermentation; controlled malolactic fermentation; industrial production with flavor modifications).

Statistically significant bivariate associations with weight status were then entered into a multivariate logistic regression model that estimated associations with being overweight/obese.Results.Sex (female), race (nonwhite), older age, higher Global PSQI score, lower ecSI total score, and higher TFEQ Emotional Eating Scale score were significantly (p {$<$} .05) associated with overweight/obesity in bivariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex (female; odds ratio [OR] = 2.05, confidence interval [CI] = 1.54?2.74), older age (OR = 1.35, CI= 1.21?1.50), higher Global PSQI score (OR = 1.07, CI = 1.01?1.13), and lower ecSI score (OR = .96, CI = .94?.98), were significantly (p {$<$} .05) associated with overweight/obesity.Conclusion.Findings suggest that obesity prevention interventions for college students should include an education component to emphasize the importance of overall sleep quality and improving eating competence.}

Consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables could help to prevent obesity and related non-communicable illness. A prominent role in children's food-related consumer socialization is played by social agents such as peers, siblings and social media. This study aims to explore the importance of peers, siblings and social media for children's food-related consumer socialization. Using a parallel, mixed-methods approach, the study finds that peers' influence on children's eating behavior is more prominent for children's healthy eating behavior than the influence of sib\- lings. Siblings' influence becomes important in the context of eating together with the whole family. Social media contributes to children's consumer socialization by exposing children to food and drink products shown on social media platforms that are frequently used by children to interact with peers and share experiences. Peer, sibling and social media influence can be used in creating marketing strategies to promote healthy eating behavior among children.},

The analysis is based on a sample of over 2700 recentvintage cabernet sauvignon wines evaluated by Wine Spectator. I estimate a dynamic wine price model to evaluate the marketing effect of the note, controlling for quality measures as well as other wine characteristics. The results indicate that the length of the tasting note exerts a strong positive influence on the wine's price, even after controlling for quality. A 10 percent increase in the number of characters in the tasting note (about 23 additional characters) contributes about two to four dollars to the price of the wine. Further analysis reveals that the value of the tasting note does not come from the ``analytical'' words contained in the note but rather, from the more subjective component of it.},

The present research proposes the distinctiveness theory of skilled memory, which states that knowledge improves memory not only through improved organizational processing but also through more effective processing of differences between items in the context of the similarity defined by organization. Individuals with either high or low knowledge about NFL football were presented with lists containing items from the target domain (NFL football) or a control domain (cooking). Individuals either performed a category sorting task, a pleasantness rating task, or both. Results on a surprise free recall test later showed knowledge effects on memory (high knowledge individuals had greater recall than low knowledge individuals for football items but not for cooking items). Secondary measures established that the knowledge effect on memory was due not only to better organizational processing but also to more effective item-specific processing.},

Seventy-four Finnish subjects with a background in culinary preparation and in food science were divided into three clusters, based on involvement with and subjective knowledge of olive oil, and knowledge of the sensory descriptors appropriate for EVOOs. They were presented with four Italian or Italian branded EVOOs (two excellent, two regular quality) as such and paired with salad. Subjects rated their overall liking and the extent to which each product met their expectation regarding the appearance and overall sensory properties. Sensory profiles of the target oils were defined in a separate trained panel. On average, the subjects disliked the deep green colour of one of the excellent oils. When presented with salad, liking for the colour of this oil increased in all clusters, but the overall liking of all oils remained unaffected. One of the two regular quality oils was best liked by the subjects. Its overall sensory properties highly matched the expectations of EVOO. Similarly to other groups, the most committed cluster also considered the least bitter and pungent regular oil as the most `typical' EVOO, and failed to accept the oils with excellent quality. In conclusion, commitment to or involvement with a product category does not guarantee the appreciation of a high quality product.},

The Eating Motivation Survey (TEMS) was developed within a frame of three different studies.

In Study 2, 1250 respondents were provided with a set of motives from Study 1 and the Eating Motivation Survey was finalized. In Study 3, a sample of 1040 participants filled in the Eating Motivation Survey. Confirmatory factor analysis with fifteen factors for food choice yielded a satisfactory model fit for a full (78 items) and brief survey version (45 items) with RMSEA .048 and .037, 90\% CI .047\textendash.049 and .035\textendash.039, respectively. Factor structure was generally invariant across random selected groups, gender, and BMI, which indicates a high stability for the Eating Motivation Survey. On the mean level, however, significant differences in motivation for food choice associated with gender, age, and BMI emerged. Implications of the fifteen distinct motivations to choose foods in everyday life are discussed.},

Cheeses selected for testing varied in milk source, regional origin, processing method, and maturation time. After reviewing previously published terminology for cheese, the panelists established terminology for aroma and flavor attributes. The 31 attributes that were needed to completely describe the 43 cheeses can be classified into seven categories: fundamental tastes, dairy aromatics, fatty acid/animal, musty/fungal, aged/fermented, mouthfeelings, and other aromatics. Many of these terms were found in published general cheese lexicons, but some are new attributes specific to French cheese.},

  abstract = {There is ample evidence to suggest that a significant part of daily eating behaviours consists of habits. In line with this, the concept of habit is increasingly incorporated into studies investigating the behavioural and psychosocial determinants of food choice, yielding evidence that habit is one of the most powerful predictors of eating behaviour. Research shows that habitual behaviour is fundamentally different from non-habitual behaviour: when behaviour is habitual, people require little information to make decisions, intentions are poor predictors of behaviour, and behaviour is triggered by situational cues. These insights have vast implications for research in the food domain that are only just beginning to be addressed. Also, theorizing on habits has important implications for behaviour change interventions, yet few interventions that are based on habit theory have been tested in a food context. The present article provides an overview of habit research and discusses possibilities to increase our knowledge of the role of habits in eating behaviour. It is shown that interventions targeting habitual behaviour can try to (i) change the situation that triggers the habitual behaviour, (ii) promote or inhibit the habitual response and (iii) change relevant contingencies. These insights can act as a starting point for future intervention research.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: The study explores the diversity in sensory characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Australia and analyses the relationship between sensory attributes and wine composition. Methods and Results: Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted by eighteen panelists who rated the intensity of 16 aroma attributes and four taste attributes. Sensory results indicated that 15 of the 20 sensory attributes assessed were significantly different among the wines assessed. The primary differentiation was between wines that were fruity and those that exhibited vegetal and herbaceous characteristics. A recently developed analytical method (headspace solid-phase microextraction comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-offlight mass spectrometry) was used to analyse over 350 volatile compounds in the wines assessed. Other measures of the major non-volatile components including ethanol, phenolics, acids and sugars were also determined. Compositional results were used to predict each sensory attribute using partial least squares regression and showed that each sensory attribute could be well explained by the compositional results. Conclusions: The results of this study further demonstrate that the sensory perception of wine is complex and involves the interaction of both volatile and non-volatile components. The use of a recently developed analytical technique allows the researcher greater capacity to explore complex relationships between wine sensory characteristics and wine composition.},

In all three studies, there was no evidence for peak, primacy or recency effects.

Offering vegetable choice was expected to increase the children's vegetable intake due to increased personal autonomy. The option for the children to choose the vegetables to ingest was varied across three different conditions. Within the discrete choice condition (DCC), children could choose the target vegetable at the beginning of the meal; within the continued discrete choice plus variety condition (CDCP), children were exposed to a variety of vegetables (zucchini and green beans), so that they could choose the target vegetable whenever they made a bite during the whole meal. Within the no-choice condition (NCC), children were alternately exposed to only one kind of vegetable, so that no choice possibility was provided. The choice conditions (CDCP and DCC) were associated with higher vegetable intake, in comparison to the no-choice control condition (NCC). No significant differences were found between the DCC and the CDCP regarding participants' total vegetable intake. These results demonstrate the enhancing effect of providing choice to increase vegetable intake in young children. A higher degree of personal control and consequent level of intrinsic motivation is hypothesized to underlie the effect of choice availability.},

One synapse on, in the orbitofrontal cortex, these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by learning with olfactory and visual inputs. Different neurons respond to different combinations, providing a rich representation of the sensory properties of food. In the orbitofrontal cortex, feeding to satiety with one food decreases the responses of these neurons to that food, but not to other foods, showing that sensory-specific satiety is computed in the primate (including human) orbitofrontal cortex. Consistently, activation of parts of the human orbitofrontal cortex correlates with subjective ratings of the pleasantness of the taste and smell of food. Cognitive factors, such as a word label presented with an odour, influence the pleasantness of the odour, and the activation produced by the odour in the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings provide a basis for understanding how what is in the mouth is represented by independent information channels in the brain; how the information from these channels is combined; and how and where the reward and subjective affective value of food is represented and is influenced by satiety signals. Activation of these representations in the orbitofrontal cortex may provide the goal for eating, and understanding them helps to provide a basis for understanding appetite and its disorders.},

  abstract = {Several methods have been proposed in the literature to analyze conventional sensory profiling data. We focus on factor analytical methods which have been extensively used due to their ability to produce graphical displays which are both useful and easy to interpret. Available factor analytical methods include principal components analysis on averaged assessors data or on the data matrix obtained by stacking the assessors' datasets one on top of the others, and canonical variates analysis; each method has advantages and drawbacks. As an alternative it is advocated the use of PLS discriminant analysis, which is at the intersection of the methods mentioned above. This method of analysis takes account of the within and between product variations while minimizing the impact of multicolinearity. It provides statistical tools to assess on the one hand the agreement among assessors and the discrimination among products by means of the between to total variance ratio, and on the other hand the relative importance of variables by means of VIP (variable importance in the projection) indices.

In this paper, PLS discriminant analysis is compared with other methods, and results are illustrated through a case study. In particular, the stability of the various methods is investigated using assessors' re-sampling (bootstrap) and confidence ellipses.},

In this study, the objective was to discriminate whiskies according to their geographical origin and authenticate the maturation time in cask based on the non-volatile profiles. The combination of FT-ICR-MS and chemometrics allowed the distinction of whiskies from four geographical origins in Scotland (Highlands, Lowlands, Speyside and Islay). Statistical modeling was also used to discriminate whiskies according to the maturation time in cask and reveal chemical markers associated with the ageing regardless of the origin or the production process. Interestingly, the flow of transfer of compounds from wood barrels to distillates is not constant and homogeneous over the maturation time. The largest transfer of compounds from the barrel to the whisky was observed around twelve years of maturation.},

Two putatively different products will always be found to be different provided that the sample size is large enough. This fact underscores the need to set {$\delta$}R. The concept of discriminators is attractive but flawed, as the same underlying sensory difference will result in different proportions of distinguishers depending on the method used. Prescott, Leslie, Kunst, and Kim (2005) proposed the idea of consumer rejection threshold which avoids the pitfalls of the proportion of discriminators concept. However, it is limited to differences that can be linked to a specific compound, such as one responsible for a product defect or off-flavor. In this manuscript two alternative approaches are discussed. The first one uses a special feature of the same-different protocol which permits the estimation of the size of the sensory difference above which consumers would call two products ``different''. The second one links the estimate of a standardized measure of sensory difference, d{${'}$}, to consumer hedonic response between the product pairs and finds the threshold above which a sensory difference results in a meaningful preference result. Experimental research is needed to study the suitability of these approaches. Ultimately, establishing {$\delta$}R is essential to ensure that results from a discrimination testing program are actually relevant to the consumers whose behavior it is trying to predict.},

From these results, we suggest that there is a dissociation of olfactory processes, with involvement of the right hemisphere in memory processes and the left hemisphere in emotional processes. The review concludes with a summary of how these lateralized processes are consistent with the gestalt-nature of our olfactory perception.},

Although there are merits in this organization, a perhaps unintended result is that psychology has paid minimal attention to the major domains of life and how people function in them. Examination of contemporary major introductory, social, and developmental psychology textbooks reveals that their indexes include almost no terms representing five critical domains: food, politics, religion, leisure-entertainment, and work. The process division of psychology dates back at least to Wundt and James, and probably derives from psychology's origins and early dedication to discovering general laws of the mind. The avoidance of study of life domains in psychology is related to several forces, including a downgrading of both applied research and descriptive research in favor of theory and laboratory experimentation. Psychology would profit from paying greater attention to describing and explaining what people actually do, an endeavor that would perhaps be facilitated by a focus on the domains of daily life.},

Using perceptual mapping, we demonstrate that medium and long-chain NEFA have a taste sensation that is distinct from other basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). Although some overlap was observed between these NEFA and umami taste, this overlap is likely due to unfamiliarity with umami sensations rather than true similarity. Shorter chain fatty acids stimulate a sensation similar to sour, but as chain length increases this sensation changes. Fat taste oral signaling, and the different signals caused by different alkyl chain lengths, may hold implications for food product development, clinical practice, and public health policy.},

Understanding and satisfying stakeholder needs and wants is the difference between the success and failure of a product. However, RE is often perceived as a ``soft'' skill by students and is often ignored by students who prioritize the learning of coding, testing, and algorithmic thinking. This view contrasts with the industry, where ``soft'' skills are instead valued equal to any other engineering ability. A key challenge in teaching RE is that students who are accustomed to technical work have a hard time relating to something that is non-technical. Furthermore, students are rarely afforded the opportunity to practice requirements elicitation and management skills in a meaningful way while learning the RE concepts as an adjunct to other content. At Rose-Hulman, several project-based approaches have been experimented with in teaching RE, and these have evolved over time. In this paper, the progress of teaching methodologies is documented to capture the pros and cons of these varied approaches, and to reflect on what worked and what did not in teaching RE to undergraduate engineering students.},

Conclusive correlations between inhibition and mDP, total polyphenol, and flavanol contents were not found. Our data suggest that enzyme inhibition activities of cocoa are not uniformly reduced by polyphenol/flavanol losses during fermentation and roasting.

  abstract = {The value consumers put on specific products depends on the information they can get from experience and from the commercial description of the products. For wine, this information derives mainly from tasting (intrinsic factors) and from the packaging of the bottles (extrinsic factors). The main purpose of this work is to compare different methodologies able to disclose the extrinsic factors playing an important role in wine quality perception of consumers. Twenty-four Chardonnay commercial wines were selected according to different criteria such as origin, denomination of origin and information provided in the label or back label. Forty-eight participants living in Burgundy took part in the study. Two incentive-compatible marketing and economic based purchase methodologies were compared: choice and auction approach, as well as a laboratory categorization task based on sensory analysis methodology at three quality levels (low, average and high quality). In all cases wines were evaluated by examination of the bottles with no tasting. Relative choice and willingness to pay (WTP) ranking for samples were consistent across both purchase methods (choice and auction approaches) however, consumers gave higher prices in the choice approach. The categorization task gives similar results as the two purchase tasks. Results show that it exists an important trade-off in quality perception among different extrinsic cues such as origin, denomination of origin (1er Cru vs vin de pays), label aesthetic (classical vs modern), bottling (estate vs cooperative bottled), the presence of awards as well as different cues commonly linked to tradition such as ``special cuv\'ee'' or being produced by independent winemakers or being perceived as a wine with a potential for ageing.},

MLF develops spontaneously in cider making at industrial level. In this work, industrial cider samples were inoculated with selected indigenous Oenococcus oeni strains and the benefits on the aroma and flavour in cider production compared to non-inoculated ciders were evaluated. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR was used to monitor strain colonization ability, outnumbering the indigenous microbiota, after completion of the alcoholic fermentation at industrial scale (20,000~l). Aroma-active compounds of experimentally inoculated ciders were analysed by HPLC and GC\textendash MS, and sensory profiles were determined by fractioning aroma extracts using reversed-phase HPLC. Principal component analysis allowed the identification of relationships and differences among ciders with or without inoculation, including several highly appreciated commercial ones obtained under spontaneous conditions. Under controlled inoculation conditions, not only could MLF be shortened by half but, interestingly, enhancement of aroma complexity and flavour resulted in ciders enriched with a higher fruity note. In addition, important aromatic groups analysed here had not been previously described, thus affording deeper knowledge on aroma characterization of apple cider.}

The modification of the simple sorting task aimed to encourage consumers to further discriminate products through sub-groupings of products within the groups they had already made. Sorting data were analyzed using a 3-way extension of classical multidimensional scaling called DISTATIS which explores the level of consumer agreement as well as the structure of the extra virgin olive oil products. Consumer agreements were explained by 46\% of the variances found in the ways consumers sorted the bottles. Decreased amount of explained variance from the first stage to the second stage of the sorting task was observed in the olive oil product structures. Consumers were asked to describe the characteristics defining each group formed. Consumer comments were analyzed qualitatively prior to statistical analysis and were later used to understand the sorting results. Despite background differences in the usage of olive oil products, the majority of the consumers perceived the product set similarly. The two-stage sorting task allowed subjects to provide more criteria or multidimensional views of their perception of the products.},

It aims to synthesize and analyze theoretical and empirical studies on the theme in order to present Bourdieu's contributions to the field, advances in his theories, and directions for future research. Exclusion criteria were: not written in Portuguese, English, Spanish, or French; not published in a peer-reviewed journal; not analyzing food or eating; and not using Bourdieu's concepts as presented in Distinction as the main theoretical framework. In this narrative review, we found 38 articles, which were categorized main themes: food choice and provisioning, taste, social class, food symbolism, the body, and the scientific field of food and eating. The taste of luxury and the taste of necessity were broadly applied on the works found in this review and were observed among the lower and upper classes, manifesting differently in each class. These studies show that while Bourdieu's theories are still highly relevant to understanding contemporary social groups, they may be improved when combined with other frameworks and theorists. We highlight as directions for future research manners in which gender and the environment interact with the habitus and food choices. Finally, this review points to new areas of investigation that may help improve the use of Bourdieu's concepts in exploring health inequalities, such as differences in eating practices and habitus within populations with low socioeconomic status.},

The model is predicated on the utility and effectiveness of biopsychosocial processes: hunger and the drive to survive, appetite and the need for subjective reward and the biological propensity to maintain preferred and stable body weight. According to ecSatter, competent eaters have 1) positive attitudes about eating and about food, 2) food acceptance skills that support eating an ever-increasing variety of the available food, 3) internal regulation skills that allow intuitively consuming enough food to give energy and stamina and to support stable body weight, and 4) skills and resources for managing the food context and orchestrating family meals. Identifying these four constructs allows nutrition professionals to target interventions as well as trust and support the individual's own capabilities and tendency to learn and grow.},

The texts were submitted to an objective lexical analysis that quantified the important variation among the experts. In addition a matching task was performed by 117 assessors in which each assessor received from each expert six white cards and six yellow cards representing the descriptions of the six white wines and six red wines. The assessors were incapable of matching the descriptions for the same expert. Comparison between the observed distribution of the number of correct matching and the expected random distribution leads to significant differences, but with a tendency in the direction of false matching: the number of 0 and 1 correct matches is too high and, conversely, the number of 2, 3 and 4 correct matches is too low, in comparison to chance. Our conclusion is that, in order to become a useful technique in food science, the free-description of food qualities given by experts requires in-depth methodological examination.},

However, none of these claims seems to be well-founded. Although responses on the LMS are highly similar to those obtained through magnitude estimation, it is questionable whether any of these methods yields ratio-level data. In addition, comparing LMS data between individuals and groups may be invalid, because LMS data vary with manipulation of experimental context. Furthermore, restricting the LMS at the upper end of the scale possibly makes it susceptible to ceiling effects. Therefore, none of the original claims seems to hold. Moreover, the LMS holds a disadvantage compared to more traditional scaling methods, in that no simple cognitive algebraic model seems to underlie its responses, which makes it unclear what LMS responses exactly signify.},

The factorial invariance of the Satisfaction with Foodrelated Life (SWFL) scale across university students from Chile and Spain was evaluated. Then, mean levels of the SWFL scores among these groups were compared. Through non-probabilistic sampling, 252 university students from Chile (61.5\% women, mean age = 22.9, SD = 2.21) and 120 students from Spain (53.5\% women; mean age = 22.0, SD = 2.5) completed the SWFL. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine cross-cultural measurement invariance. Results showed that the SWFL scale exhibited strict invariance (equal factor loadings, thresholds and residuals) when comparing the Chilean and Spanish student samples. Therefore, the similar structure of the SWFL scale across these samples provides the basis for meaningful international comparisons of Satisfaction with Food-related Life. This finding allows the creation of common policies that can improve food-related well-being and the quality of life of university students and for people during different stages of life. The Spanish sample had a significantly higher SWFL score than the Chilean sample, probably linked to the significantly higher mean score in the items related to pleasure, ideal food and life conditions associated with food of the SWFL scale. Limitations and suggestions for future research in measuring Satisfaction with Food related Life are discussed.},

The present paper examines whether Self-Determination Theory (SDT) can be of help in fostering more sustainable food choices by taking a closer look at the relationship between food-related types of motivation and different aspects of meat consumption, based on a survey among 1083 consumers in the Netherlands. SDT appeared to be useful for studying why consumers can be motivated to make more sustainable food choices and also why these preferences are not shared by all consumers. Consumers with different types of motivation differed in their level of meat consumption (frequency and portion size), reasons for not frequently eating meat, frequency of buying carefully produced meat, frequency of buying meat substitutes, and preferences in favor or not of plant-based protein products. Internalized motivation was the main factor that made a difference, but intrinsic enjoyment of cooking and eating also played a role. The conclusion is that SDT provides both theoretical and policy-oriented insights into fostering more sustainable food choices.},

Over the years, as sensory evaluation groups grew in size and relevance in companies, the use of consumer data grew markedly and emphasized the product development guidance role. Moreover, consumer data were increasingly used in quality control to complement the standard instrumental techniques. Another extension of the product development role has been in the use of consumer data in a variety of product optimization models and in the collection of cognitive data. The sensible use of consumer data has made a signi\textregistered cant contribution to sensory science and its clients, but there are many ``nonsensical'' uses and interpretations of consumer data which can lead to inappropriate generalizations about products or populations. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The most widely used scalefor assessingfood liking or disliking is the 9-pt hedonic scale. Unfortunately, this affective scale suffersfrom problems related to unequal scale intervals and the underuse of end categories, which results in a reduced ability to differentiate among extremely well liked or extremely dislikedfoods. Magnitude estimationavoids theseproblems while enabling ratio statements to be made about the data. However, it does not provide absolute ratings of liking/disliking and can be difficult for some consumers to use. We report here on the development of a labeled affective magnitude scale (LAM) scale that has advantages over both the 9-pt hedonic scale and magnitude estimation. Fortyfour semanticlabels were scaledfor theiraffective meaning by subjects using modulus-free magnitude estimation. The geometric mean magnitude estimates obtainedfor each semantic label were used to construct a series of labeled affective magnitude scales by spacing the labels along a visual analogue scale according to their obtained semantic values. Reliability and sensitivity studies were conducted to assess the Uects of alternative semantic and numeric labels. The results of these studies led to the choice of a scale format that uses verbal labels that are consistent with the 9-pt hedonic scale. The labeled affective magnitude (LAM)scale was compared to the hedonic scale and magnitude estimation in severalfood preference and acceptability tests. The LAM was shown to have equal reliability and sensitivity to the hedonic scale, provided somewhatgreater discriminationamonghighlylikedfoods, and resulted in h t a that were similar to magnitude estimation in terms of the obtained ratios among rated stimuli. TheLAM scale wasalsojudged by consumersto be aseasy to use as the 9-pt hedonic scale and signijicantly less diflcult than magnitude estimation.},

Despite this industry growth, mead sensory studies are limited and focus on experimental samples and hedonic assessments. The aim of this study was to create a lexicon to standardize the language used to describe mead attributes and to create a mead aroma wheel for use as an assistive tool for mead judges, producers, and consumers.A trained panel developed a lexicon of seventy-five aroma, five basic taste, and six mouthfeel sensation terms to describe commercial mead.Reference standards for each attribute were included for consistency and reproducibility.An open-access Traditional Mead Aroma Wheel organizes seventy-five aroma descriptors into a visual tool with suggestions for a standardized mead evaluationImpact and Significance: Terms used to describe mead sensory attributes vary based on industry role, experience, and, in the case of mead competitions, scoresheets. A standardized lexicon is proposed as a method of unifying terms for mead description regardless of expertise. This lexicon was adapted into a visual tool, the Traditional Mead Aroma Wheel, to aid in mead evaluation during production, at competitions, and in the taproom.},

The sensory attribute pool was obtained through the following four steps: first, collection of descriptors associated with sensory attributes of coffee; second, selection of the representative terms; third, development of the definition and reference; and fourth, verification of the developed definitions. The sensory attribute pool as qualitative profiling consisted of 74 terms with their definitions and references. The pool included 16 unique sensory attributes specially influenced by Korean culture and linguistics, as well as other ones that had been mentioned previously. In addition, the different descriptive patterns of terms were observed among descriptors generated through MAL, consumers and trained panelists. These results suggest that the expressions of perceived attributes are affected by many factors including culture, language, context and training.},

To examine affective attitudes to odors (i.e., pleasantness), participants were also asked to list 3 odors as being the most pleasant or unpleasant, respectively. Next, the mentioned odor names were attributed to 1 of 4 main categories: ``Food \& Drink,'' ``Social relationship,'' ``Nature,'' and ``Civilization'' and the distribution of these categories was compared across regions. Mexicans were significantly different to the other regions in their general attitudes toward olfaction. In addition, in all regions, in comparison with men, women indicated a higher interest in the sense of smell. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was present between individuals' self-rating of olfactory sensitivity and general attitudes toward olfaction. Finally, there were significant cross-regional differences in affective attitudes toward specific categories of odors. In conclusion, our findings support and extend the notion that regions affect attitudes toward the olfactory world.},

I describe notions of subjectivity implicated in that inattention; I trace potentially constructive links between contemporary science studies and resources in 18th-century philosophical aesthetics; I draw notice to available engagements with the mode of subjectivity known as taste, and, especially, gustation and olfaction; and I suggest ways in which we might study the achievement of intersubjectivity in these domains.},

The essay shows that these vocabularies have shifted from the spare to the elaborate, from medical implications to aesthetic analyses, from a leading concern with ``goodness'' (authenticity, soundness) to interest in the analytic description of component flavors and odors. The causes of these changes are various: one involves the importance, and eventual disappearance, of a traditional physiological framework for appreciating the powers and qualities of different sorts of aliment, including wines; another concerns the development of chemical sciences concerned with flavor components; and still another flows from changing social and economic circumstances in which wine was consumed and the functions served by languages of connoisseurship. The historical span surveyed here extends from Antiquity to the present and the essay displays talk about wine tastes as a perspicuous site for understanding aspects of wide-ranging social and cultural change.},

In Japanese, "metaphor," "onomatopoeia," and "adjectives generally not for food" are often used to express the taste and texture of food. Which and how the expression is used depends on individual sensibility based on location and generation; especially, the youngers sometimes use new expressions. Since, it is difficult to extract Japanese taste and texture expressions from Web reviews based on a fixed dictionary. This paper proposes an interactive framework to collect Japanese taste and texture expressions for food. Using the proposed framework, varied and many expressions would be semi-automatically collected. Based on the collected expressions, the sentiment analysis for food will be facilitated.},

  abstract = {Individual sensory properties of food and beverages are not perceived independently during consumption and their interaction will determine what consumers perceive and prefer. Many dynamic processes are involved in flavour release during the consumption experience and therefore its perception should be measured dynamically. To investigate how dynamic sensory and emotion profiles interact and how this relates to temporal liking, this study used a multi-sip approach with temporal dominance of sensations (TDS), temporal dominance of emotions (TDE) and temporal liking (TL), to compare three beers with small sensory differences in hop aroma: control beer (0\% hop aroma), low\_c beer (0.08\% hop aroma) and high\_c beer (0.16\% hop aroma). Seventy-one beer consumers consumed a glass of each beer while performing TDE + TL and TDS + TL, on consecutive days in a sensory lab. Adding different concentrations of hop aroma in beer resulted in different dynamic sensory profiles without a difference in liking. The attribute floral was dominant in the high\_c beer and in the last stage of consumption. TDE revealed an improvement of the emotional profile of the high\_c beer at the beginning of consumption: three positive emotions, relaxed, pleased and happy were dominant, whereas for the other beers, one positive and one negative emotion were dominant, relaxed or pleased and disappointed. Overall differences between beers based on total duration of dominance were clear when looking at sensations rather than emotions while the combination of dynamic profiles of sensations and emotions showed a slight discrimination between the beers. It can be concluded that the subtle changes in the aroma resulted in differences in temporal dominance of sensations, did not affect liking and only slightly changed the emotion profile. The method used in this study remains to be proven further for use in food-related research and new product development, especially in the case of subtle changes.},

The discursive psychological perspective underlines the notion of identities being part of social actions performed in talk, and thus designed and deployed for different interactional purposes. It is demonstrated that participants draw on specific discursive devices to (1) define vegan meals as ordinary and easy to prepare and (2) construct methods of preventing vitamin deficiency, such as taking supplements, as routine procedures. In `doing being ordinary', participants systematically resist the notion that being a vegan is complicated\textemdash in other words, that it is both difficult to compose a meal and to protect your health. In this way, `ordinariness' helps to construct and protect veganism as an ideology. We point out similarities and differences with other studies on eating or healthy lifestyles and argue, more broadly, that identities and their category-bound features are part and parcel of participants' highly flexible negotiation package.},

Food choice is multifaceted as it involves whether, where, when, how long, how, why, with whom, for whom, and under what conditions eating occurs.

Food choice is dynamic as it unfolds and is embedded in eating episodes over lifetimes within historical eras. Food choice is multilevel as physical, biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors operate simultaneously and interact. Food choice is integrated as people coordinate many considerations to construct specific eating activities. Food choice is diverse in its broad scope of distinct and unique eating activities. Food choice can be examined using both multi-perspective and multi-purpose approaches, and it may not be possible to integrate different perspectives into a unified approach to understanding and changing food choice.},

Descriptive analysis (DA), time\textendash intensity analysis (TI) and temporal dominance of sensation (TDS) analysis were used to evaluate the changes in flavor of Riesling and Gew\"urztraminer wines made with varying skin contact times. DA showed that Riesling wines differed only in bitterness and color. In contrast, Gew\"urztraminer wines varied significantly in bitterness, sweetness, sourness, and astringency as well as for several aroma notes and color. 2009 and 2010 Gew\"urztraminer wines increased in intensity of honey/caramel, floral, and lemon aromas as well as yellow color, whereas peach/apricot was only significant in 2009 and apple and green grass/green banana only in 2010. Regarding the temporal properties of orally perceived modalities, bitterness TI curves recorded from Gew\"urztraminer differed significantly in maximum intensity and area under the curve, while Riesling showed no significant differences in any TI parameter. Increasing skin contact altered the dominance of orally perceived attributes. Fermenting the grapes completely on their skins produced a wine, which was significantly more bitter than all other wines according to TI and DA. However TDS analysis showed that the dominating sensation in this wine was not the bitter taste but the astringent mouth feel. TDS revealed further subtle differences caused by botrytized grape material, altering sourness and astringent perception.},

Content analysis of 2598 web-based wine reviews from well-known wine writers, including tasting notes and scores, was used to gather information about the regional profiles of Australian Cabernet Sauvignon wines and to create selection criteria for further wine studies. In addition, a wine expert panel evaluated 84 commercial Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Coonawarra, Margaret River, Yarra Valley and Bordeaux, using freely chosen descriptions and overall quality scores. Using content analysis software, a sensory lexicon of descriptor categories was built and frequencies of each category for each region were computed. Distinction between the sensory profiles of the regions was achieved by correspondence analysis (CA) using online review and expert panellist data. Wine quality scores obtained from reviews and experts were converted into Australian wine show medal categories. CA of assigned medal and descriptor frequencies revealed the sensory attributes that appeared to drive medal-winning wines. Multiple factor analysis of frequencies from the reviews and expert panellists indicated agreement about descriptors that were associated with wines of low and high quality, with greater alignment at the lower end of the wine quality assessment scale.},

  abstract = {The concept of wine typicity has been an important tool for the international wine trade, and especially for Old World wine producing countries, where provenance criteria are regulated and act as a quality indicator. Prov\- enance in Australia is governed by Geographical Indications, for which typicity should also be evident in terms of regional sensory profiles of wine from a given grape cultivar. Two approaches were used to identify sensory drivers for regional typicity of commercial Cabernet Sauvignon wines from three Australian regions, namely Coonawarra, Margaret River, and Yarra Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wines from Bordeaux were also assessed for benchmarking purposes. A set of 84 wines underwent a sorting task and rate-all-that-apply (RATA) analysis of the sorted groups with an expert panel. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the sorting task data did not show a clear regional driver upon separating the samples into four main clusters, although certain sensory traits could be associated with the different clusters. On the other hand, canonical variate analysis (CVA) of the group-RATA results indicated several sensory drivers for the separation between the regions, such as `mint' and `dark fruits' being important for Coonawarra wine profiles, `floral' and `green pepper' for Margaret River, `stemmy' for Yarra Valley, and `barnyard' and `savoury' differentiating Bordeaux wines from the other regions. A subset (n = 52) of wines was selected for further evaluation by descriptive analysis with a trained panel. Statistical evaluation with CVA revealed similar results to the expert evaluation, with Bordeaux wines showing more dissimilarity when compared to Australian regions, and having `savoury' and `earthy' as significant characters. The results also demonstrated that `mint' and `Mallee leaf' were relevant characters for Coonawarra regional sensory profile, `violets' and `red fruits' for Margaret River, and `cooked vegetables' for Yarra Valley. Analysing both data sets (expert RATA and DA) revealed some agreement between the sets of results for attri\- butes such as `mint', `cooked vegetables', `floral', green-related characters, and oak characters like `vanilla' and `chocolate'. Overall, experts and trained panellists were able to distinguish regions based on a few characteristic sensory traits.},

  abstract = {A series of weaknesses in creativity, research design, and quality of writing continue to handicap energy social science. Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.},

  abstract = {The taste of foodstuffs has shaped entire economic systems. Yet many scholars have understood how one tastes as only a matter of aesthetics. New forms of doing work through the senses, associated with twentieth-century industrialized food production, have made it clear that the sensations produced by mouths and noses do more than mark class\textemdash they carry economic value. It seems that it is time we attend more closely to this sensory labor and its place in the food system. Recognizing perception as a form of labor mobilized throughout the food system offers to dissolve the apparent dichotomy between a focus on food as an object of consumption, evaluated on its aesthetic principles, and of production, evaluated on its ethical implications. Sustained examination of sensing as found in the essays in this issue demonstrates that the types and modes of sensory labor mobilized in the provisioning, making, and eating of food are not neutral\textemdash rather they coproduce modes of food production. In doing so, these essays not only open the door for valuing otherwise unacknowledged work, but also point towards opportunities for critical intervention in how we talk about and practice taste and, in the process, make society.},

In January 2014, the municipal water supply of Charleston, West Virginia was contaminated by an under-characterized chemical, crude MCHM. Even when instrumental measurements no longer detected the chemical, people continued to smell its licorice-like odor. In a space where nothing was certain, smell became the only indicator of potential harm. Officials responded by commissioning state-funded sensory testing of crude MCHM to determine its sensory threshold. Via the critical passage point of sensory science, some instances of embodied attunement were allowed to enter into the evidentiary regimes of perception, while other, similarly trained moments of attunement were excluded from the process. This, I show, produced knowledge about the spilled chemical that maintained the systems that contributed to the spill in the first place. Drawing on new materialist thought, I riff on biology and ?transduce? the ephemeral phenomena of smelling crude MCHM into a new medium: Rather than thinking of smell as a volatile molecular material (an odorant), I show that consideration of smell as a manipulable object that one can imagine as having tangible substance and shape offers a way to experiment with disciplinary forms. I suggest an alternate future, where sensory science acts to record sensory labor that produces facts about collective experience that cannot (easily) travel through current systems, a process that is one possible way of beginning to unravel entrenched systems of toxic harm.},

The foodstuffs tested in this study included still and sparkling water, Brie cheese and cranberry juice, and two kinds of chocolate. Participants were given paper-based line scales, anchored at either end with a nonsense word or simple outline shape. They were instructed to taste the foodstuffs and to indicate whether their perception of the flavour matched more one or other of the items anchoring the scales, and then mark the appropriate point on the scale. The results highlight the fact that certain of these foodstuffs (sparkling water, cranberry juice, and Maltesers \textendash{} chocolate-covered malt honeycomb) were better associated with angular shapes and high-pitched meaningless words, such as `kiki' and `takete', whose pronunciation requires sharp inflection of the mouth. By contrast, still water, Brie, and Caramel Nibbles (chocolate-covered caramel) were all more strongly associated with rounded shapes and softer sounding, lower-pitched pseudo-words, such as `bouba' and `maluma'. These results, which build on the classic literature on `sound symbolism', have both theoretical and applied implications: On the one hand, they demonstrate that the phenomenon of sound symbolism extends beyond the visual modality, by showing that speech sounds carry meaning in the domain of flavour, and in terms of the oral-somatosensory attributes of foodstuffs as well. As a consequence, these results may also be useful on an applied level in terms of helping companies to design novel brand names and graphics for the packaging of their food and drink items that best connote the likely attributes of the product within.},

  abstract = {Background: Given the worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity, there is a clear need for meaningful practical healthy eating advice - not only in relation to food choice, but also on appropriate food portion sizes. As the majority of portion size research to date has been overwhelmingly quantitative in design, there is a clear need to qualitatively explore consumers' views in order to fully understand how food portion size decisions are made. Using qualitative methodology this present study aimed to explore consumers' views about factors influencing their portion size selection and consumption and to identify barriers to appropriate portion size control. Methods: Ten focus groups with four to nine participants in each were formed with a total of 66 persons (aged 19\textendash 64 years) living on the island of Ireland. The semi-structured discussions elicited participants' perceptions of suggested serving size guidance and explored the influence of personal, social and environmental factors on their food portion size consumption. Audiotapes of the discussions were professionally transcribed verbatim, loaded into NVivo 9, and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis procedure. Results: The rich descriptive data derived from participants highlight that unhealthy portion size behaviors emanate from various psychological, social and behavioral factors. These bypass reflective and deliberative control, and converge to constitute significant barriers to healthy portion size control. Seven significant barriers to healthy portion size control were apparent: (1) lack of clarity and irrelevance of suggested serving size guidance; (2) guiltless eating; (3) lack of self-control over food cues; (4) distracted eating; (5) social pressures; (6) emotional eating rewards; and (7) quantification habits ingrained from childhood. Conclusions: Portion size control strategies should empower consumers to overcome these effects so that the consumption of appropriate food portion sizes becomes automatic and habitual.},

While several influential early commentators argued against there being any relationship, a large body of empirical evidence published over the last 80 years or so clearly demonstrates that the hue and saturation, or intensity, of color in food and/or drink often influences multisensory flavor perception. Interestingly, the majority of this research has focused on vision's influence on the tasting experience rather than looking for any effects in the opposite direction. Recently, however, a separate body of research linking color and taste has emerged from the burgeoning literature on the crossmodal correspondences. Such correspondences, or associations, between attributes or dimensions of experience, are thought to be robustly bidirectional. When talking about the relationship between color and taste/flavor, some commentators would appear to assume that these two distinct literatures describe the same underlying empirical phenomenon. That said, a couple of important differences (in terms of the bidirectionality of the effects and their relative vs. absolute nature) are highlighted, meaning that the findings from one domain may not necessarily always be transferable to the other, as is often seemingly assumed.},

On three occasions, different portions of tomato soup (150, 225, and 300 g) were served at the start of the meal, and on one occasion no soup was served. Children had 10 min to consume the soup before being served the main course. All foods were consumed ad libitum. The primary outcomes were soup intake as well as energy and vegetable intake at the main course. A mixed linear model tested the effect of soup portion size on intake. Serving any portion of soup reduced entre\textasciiacute{} e energy intake compared with serving no soup, but total meal energy intake was only reduced when 150 g of soup was served. Increasing the portion size increased soup and vegetable intake.

Secondly, origin can affect directly the value of food due to its symbolic or affective role. This study was carried out in order to investigate the direct effect of geographical origin when the size of the area of origin shrinks and its definition becomes more precise. A valuation experiment was designed to assess the impact of origin on consumer evaluation and to analyse how it relates to WTP and hedonic scores. A well-known specialty food\textemdash spelt\textemdash that originates from three concentric areas\textemdash Garfagnana (a small valley of the Apennines), Tuscany and Italy\textemdash was chosen as a case study. Both hedonic and monetary evaluations were elicited from 77 subjects after blind tasting condition, looking at labels only and finally tasting a labelled product.

Three major classes of function were identified, relating to Ingestion (Detection/identification prior to ingestion; Detection of expectancy violations; Appetite regulation; Breast orientation and feeding), Avoiding environmental hazards (Fear related; Disgust related), and Social communication (Reproductive [inbreeding avoidance, fitness detection in prospective mates]; Emotional contagion [fear contagion, stress buffering]). These suggested functions were then examined with respect to 1) issues of ecological validity in human olfactory research; 2) their impact on olfactory loss; and 3) their general and specific implications for the study of human olfaction.},

  abstract = {Flavour results primarily from the combination of three discrete senses: taste, somatosensation and olfaction. In contrast to this scientific description, most people seem unaware that olfaction is involved in flavour perception. They also appear poorer at detecting the olfactory components of a flavour relative to the taste and somatosensory parts. These and other findings suggest that flavour may in part be treated as a unitary experience. In this article, I examine the mechanisms that may contribute to this unification, in particular the role of attention. Drawing on recent work, the evidence suggests that concurrent gustatory and somatosensory stimulation capture attention at the expense of the olfactory channel. Not only does this make it hard to voluntarily attend to the olfactory channel, but it also can explain why olfaction goes largely unnoticed in our day-to-day experience of flavour. It also provides a useful framework for conceptualizing how the unitary experience of flavour may arise from three anatomically discrete sensory systems.},

How do people dwelling in them become attuned to the sense of something coming into existence or something waning, sagging, dissipating, enduring, or resonating with what is lost or promising? I suggest that atmospheric attunements are palpable and sensory yet imaginary and uncontained, material yet abstract. They have rhythms, valences, moods, sensations, tempos, and lifespans. They can pull the senses into alert or incite distraction or denial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Research has demonstrated that factors external to the food source can influence consumers' perceptions of food. Contextual factors including cutlery or tableware (for example, size and composition), the atmosphere (for example, noise levels and odours), and packaging (for example, shape and colour) have all been shown to influence the perceptual experience. Plateware has also been shown to influence taste perception since ratings of a dessert (strawberry mousse) were modified by plate colour but not by plate shape. In the current study, which used a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, the effect of plate colour (black versus white) and plate shape (round versus square) on taste perception is re-examined. Through sweetness, intensity, quality, and liking ratings of cheesecake, the current study extends the previous investigation to include an examination of the plate colour by plate shape interaction while using plates with more angular corners.RESULTS:Judgments made on simple elemental properties (sweetness and flavour intensity) and higher level compound property judgments (food quality or food liking) were shown to be differentially influenced by the interaction of plate colour and plate shape. Both elemental and compound property judgments were heightened by white round plates while compound judgments were also increased when food was presented on black square plates.CONCLUSIONS:The results suggest that plate colour and shape influence taste perception but not in a straight-forward manner and instead the influence depends on the interaction of the two variables. Depending on which attribute of the perceptual experience is more important, knowledge of this interaction could be used advantageously by the culinary community.},

In general, the more people present, the more food will be eaten. Also, the better known the people present, the greater the facilitation of intake. Family and friends may produce relaxation and thereby increase meal duration. This suggests a possible explanation for the general influence of the social relationship on intake. People in general are more relaxed and comfortable with familiar people than with strangers. This causes them to stay longer at the table and continue to eat, which leads to a higher level of food intake.},

  abstract = {Whisky is one of the most popular spirit drinks in the world. Unfortunately, this highly valued commodity is vulnerable to fraud. To detect fraudulent practices and document quality parameters, a number of laboratory tests based on various principles including chromatography and spectroscopy have been developed. In most cases, the analytical methods are based on targeted screening strategies. Nontargeted screening (metabolomics fingerprinting) of (semi)volatile substances was used in our study. Following the pre-concentration of these compounds, either by solid phase microextraction (SPME) or by ethyl acetate extraction, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF mass analyser) was employed. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSeDA) were used for evaluation of data obtained by analysis of a unique set of 171 authentic whisky samples provided by the Scotch Whisky Research Institute. Very good separation of malt whiskies according to the type of cask in which they were matured (bourbon versus bourbon and wine) was achieved, and significant markers' for bourbon and wine cask maturation, such as N-(3-methylbutyl) acetamide and 5-oxooxolane-2-carboxylic acid, were identified. Subsequently, the unique sample set was used to construct a statistical model for distinguishing malt and blended whiskies. In the final phase, 20 fake samples were analysed and the data processed in the same way. Some differences could be observed in the (semi)volatile profiles of authentic and fake samples. Employing the statistical model developed by PLS-DA for this purpose, marker compounds that positively distinguish fake samples were identified.},

Focus group findings revealed that video technology was perceived to assist learning in the cooking process in the following ways: (1) improved comprehension of the cooking process; (2) real-time reassurance in the cooking process; (3) assisting the acquisition of new cooking skills; and (4) enhancing the enjoyment of the cooking process.

Given that a focus on food and the senses allows us to explore some of the most basic boundaries of inside and outside, private and public, individual and collective, this topic offers an excellent window onto that elusive notion of everyday life that anthropologists wish to understand theoretically and examine ethnographically. At the same time, food is a key component of ritual, which has typically been understood as heightening or stimulating sensory experience to instill social or cosmological values. Food and the senses overlap in notions of taste as distinction and in an increasing recognition of the culturally cultivated phenomenon of synesthesia. Furthermore, in making food and the senses central to understanding wider social issues, this review argues for the productivity of a concept of ``gustemology'' in opening up new realms of ethnographic and theoretical inquiry.},

Two hundred and fourteen participants were asked to evaluate their liking and emotional response using the Peryam and Kroll (P\&K) scale (super good/super bad) and pictorial emoji scale, respectively, for both food and non-food experiences. Scores from each grade level were not statistically different. The responses from both scales had similar mean scores and distribution patterns for all experiences with no incidence of bias toward any one emoji. These results support the suitability of the emoji scale for measuring emotional response using verbal stimuli names with children ages 8\textendash 11 in the United States and indicate it is a reasonable alternative to the P\&K scale for this demographic.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may help ease economic and time constraints of cooking, helping low-income households prepare healthier meals. Therefore, frequent cooking may be more strongly associated with improved dietary outcomes among SNAP recipients than among income-eligible non-recipients. Alternately, increased frequency of home-cooked meals among SNAP participants may be beneficial simply by replacing fast food intake. This study quantified the association between home cooking and fast food with diet intake and weight status among SNAP recipients. Methods: In 2016, data from low-income adults aged 19\textendash 65 years from the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2007\textendash 2010 (N{$\frac{1}{4}$}2,578) were used to examine associations of daily home-cooked dinner and weekly fast food intake with diet intake, including calories from solid fat and added sugar and key food groups (sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit, and vegetables), and prevalence of overweight/ obesity. Differences in these associations for SNAP recipients versus income-eligible non-recipients were analyzed, as well as whether associations were attenuated when controlling for fast food intake. Results: Daily home-cooked dinners were associated with small improvements in dietary intake for SNAP recipients but not for non-recipients, including lower sugar-sweetened beverage intake (\textendash 54 kcal/day), and reduced prevalence of overweight/obesity (\textendash 6\%) (po0.05). However, these associations were attenuated after controlling for fast food intake. Consuming at least one fast food meal/week was associated with 9.3\% and 11.6\% higher overweight/obesity prevalence among SNAP recipients and non-recipients, respectively (po0.05).

The objectives of this study were to determine if the terminology established in previous studies was adequate to evaluate a wide range of European cheeses, and to determine if a simplified ``general'' lexicon can be developed for the description of cheese. A descriptive panel evaluated the flavor of 65 western European cheeses that varied in region produced, milk source, maturation time and processing method. The panel reviewed previously published cheese attributes, definitions and references prior to beginning the testing. During testing, the panel detected and added new descriptors and eliminated terms which did not appear in any of the cheeses. Data inspection, in addition to factor analysis, suggests that 25 attributes are needed to explain the common flavor characteristics found in cheese. However, 19 additional attributes may be used occasionally to describe targeted specific flavor characteristics.},

A two-dimensional stimulus configuration best represented the data from each of the three methods. The underlying dimensions of stimulus space were identified from free-choice profiling data and also explained some background variables. The texture, sweetness, sourness, grape flavor and color contributed to both dimensions. All three methods were very similar in describing the most important differences among stimuli as suggested by the highly significant correlation between their first dimensions. The Procrustes analysis coupled with permutation tests, as well as RV coefficient, indicated that similarity scaling and free-choice profiling reached maximum consensus, whereas multidimensional sorting shared slightly lesser consensus with the other two methods.},

Advanced data mining techniques have been applied in many sectors of supply chains in the food industry. However, the previous work has mainly focused on the analysis of instrument-generated data such as those from hyperspectral imaging, spectroscopy, and biometric receptors. The importance of digital text data in the food and nutrition has only recently gained attention due to advancements in big data analytics. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the data sources, computational methods, and applications of text data in the food industry. Text mining techniques such as word-level analysis (e.g., frequency analysis), word association analysis (e.g., network analysis), and advanced techniques (e.g., text classification, text clustering, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis) will be discussed. Applications of text data analysis will be illustrated with respect to food safety and food fraud surveillance, dietary pattern characterization, consumer-opinion mining, new-product development, food knowledge discovery, food supply-chain management, and online food services. The goal is to provide insights for intelligent decision-making to improve food production, food safety, and human nutrition.},

These methodologies present drawbacks: sensory profile and TDS do not provide an effective discrimination of the taste of water and the free sorting task is efficient but does not enable data aggregation. A new methodology based on comparison with a set of references and named ``Polarized Sensory Positioning'' (PSP) has been developed enabling to easily define the sensory characteristics of water without presenting too many samples.

These chemicals give off characteristic odors, associated with descriptors such as phenolic, pharmaceutical, stable, leather, and horse. Their organoleptic impact on wine is a recurring debate among wine professionals. However, links between these compounds and an attenuation of fruity and varietal aromas in wine have been demonstrated, while several studies have highlighted the poor correlation between ethylphenol concentrations and the perception of Brett character. These variations in assessment may be explained by several perceptual factors. This article presents an investigation of perceptual skills and socio-professional parameters that affect ethylphenol assessment. As tasting performance relies on both perceptual skills and a decision-making process, several psychophysical tests (detection threshold, description task, and the Signal Detection Theory methodology) were used to assess the impact of socio-professional parameters on olfactory capacities and strategic/decisional factors. The hypothesis that expertise, in terms of age and qualifications, had an impact on the assessment of Brett character was confirmed.},

To this end we developed a preference choice experiment which was submitted to a sample of respondents during blind wine tasting meetings. The obtained results allow us to weigh up and emphasise the importance of an attractive landscape to the perception of a finer quality of wine. Indeed, we noticed that associating wine to an image of greater visual impact, i.e. an evocative landscape, induces a significantly higher preference for the tasted wine. Moreover, the integrated application of choice-based conjoint analysis and combination-based permutation tests allows us to identify the specific relationship each market segment has with landscape, price and wine quality.},

The analysis of the link between the responses and the predictors using PLS regression allows to cluster the consumers in homogeneous groups with respect to their tastes, and in such a way that their behaviour can be related to the characteristics of the products. For each group, PLS regression allows obtaining a graphical display of the products with their characteristics, and a mapping of the consumers based on their preferences. Moreover, PLS path modelling allows a detailed analysis of each group by building a causal scheme: each block of consumers is related to the physicochemical and the sensory blocks, and the sensory block is itself related to the physico-chemical block. Finally this PLS path modelling is compared with hierarchical multi-block PLS model.},

The resulting online recipe collections are repositories of ingredient combinations and cooking methods whose large-scale and variety yield interesting insights about both the fundamentals of cooking and user preferences. At the level of an individual ingredient we measure whether it tends to be essential or can be dropped or added, and whether its quantity can be modified. We also construct two types of networks to capture the relationships between ingredients. The complement network captures which ingredients tend to co-occur frequently, and is composed of two large communities: one savory, the other sweet. The substitute network, derived from user-generated suggestions for modifications, can be decomposed into many communities of functionally equivalent ingredients, and captures users' preference for healthier variants of a recipe. Our experiments reveal that recipe ratings can be well predicted with features derived from combinations of ingredient networks and nutrition information.},

An expert panel assessed the main sensory characteristics of the mayonnaises. Usually, preference mapping is applied to find out which sensory attributes drive consumer preferences for products. As an alternative, we will use the consumer statements to investigate this relationship. By counting words and looking at word combinations, we will use correspondence analysis to construct a visualization that is comparable to a preference map. Results from the analyses of the verbal responses are compared with the results from preference mapping. The agreement between the correspondence map and the preference map is striking, with the additional advantage being that the correspondence map is stated in terms of consumer language. The textual map is also in line with consumer understanding about creaminess. It appears that respondents find it easier to comment on their dislikes than on their likes.

Trained descriptive sensory panelists evaluated gelato samples in Italy, purchased direct from local gelaterias, and ice cream samples in the U.S., purchased from grocery stores and local shops. In general, gelati obtained higher overall fruity and fruit identification scores, chocolate gelati obtained higher chocolate and cocoa notes and vanilla gelati obtained higher vanilla and lower vanillin intensities than most U.S. ice creams. Gelati were consistently associated with higher density, lower firmness and slower meltdown. When compared with U.S. ice creams, Italian gelati are characterized by specific sensory properties: ?true to type? flavors ? high-intensity flavors considered to be typical to that flavor category or specific fruit and are combined with a dense, smooth texture that allows for the development of flavor, body and bloom, enhancing the perception of flavors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The research conducted in this study may be useful for ice cream manufacturers and sensory scientists. These results are the first to define sensory characteristics of high-quality Italian gelati and may be used to produce ice cream with increased consumer liking. The descriptive attributes developed can be used for the development of new flavors or for the improvement of ice cream products already on the market.}

Here, we provide insight for food-related consumer sentiment study by using online review data. We present a case study using Yelp restaurant review data on what affects restaurant customers' sentiment responses to dining out. In our case study, a sentiment-analysis method was used to extract and generate sentiment indices from 175,879 text-based Yelp restaurant reviews. We examined the relationships between our sentiment indices and ratings and showed that online review data can provide information about consumer dining sentiments. By using semi-automatic content analysis method, we first counted the most frequent 300 words in all text reviews and manually categorized those most frequent words into five topics: ``food,'' ``service,'' ``expenditure,'' ``social,'' and ``miscellany''. We then computed the fraction of topic words in each category over the total topic words for each review. We found that (1) consumers used more positive sentiment words than negative sentiment words in their Yelp restaurant text reviews. (2) The proportion of positive sentiment words in reviews was positively related to ratings; the proportion of negative sentiment words in reviews was negatively related to ratings. (3) Relative to food, consumers used more sentiment words (both positive and negative) when they were discussing restaurant service. (4) Consumers used the least sentiment words when they were discussing social-related topics compared with the other topics (food, service and expenditure). (5) Consumers rated restaurant service higher than they rated food.},

Similarly, respondents appeared to be most unwilling to reduce meat consumption and purchase organic food. Taste and environmental motives influenced consumers' willingness to eat seasonal fruits and vegetables, whereas preparedness to reduce meat consumption was influenced by health and ethical motives.

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate Mid-Atlantic USA wine consumers' preferences for front wine label attributes for a lesser-known/unknown local wine variety. The wine consumer base in this part of the USA exceeds that of California. Although the mid-Atlantic is experiencing an increase in the number of wineries, there is a lack of region-specific consumer research that could be the basis for marketing strategies that may differ from those in more established wine regions, such as CA. We recruited 1011 mid-Atlantic consumers who drank wine (at least 1\texttimes/month) to view variations of a wine label, differing in wine tag, location description, font types, and images in a choice-based conjoint experiment. A greater percentage of consumers selected the ``White Wine'' tag and scripted fonts than the other options, with a generalized county text (``Proudly produced in Lehigh County, PA'') being selected by more participants than the American Viticultural Area (AVA) (``Lehigh Valley AVA'') or state (``Pennsylvania'') texts; however, the location text had a lower importance than the wine tag variable. This study implies that a generalized county text that describes a more specific location where the grapes were grown may be more favorable to mid-Atlantic consumers in comparison to AVA or state texts, and that traditional images and generic wine labels are more preferable than wine labels they have not seen before and more contemporary label styles. Wineries in the mid-Atlantic region may want to add generalized county texts to their labels to appeal to the regional audience. As AVAs are used to promote specific wine regions in the USA, and only some consumers choose wines based on these designations, governments and marketing organizations may want to increase education on local AVAs to increase consumer awareness and interest. In addition, consumer differences in variety-seeking behavior and subjective as well as objective wine knowledge, but not attitudes toward locally produced foods, affected wine label choice: Consumers scoring higher in variety-seeking and wine knowledge preferred the specific wine varietal over the generic wine tag; similarly, consumers that indicated familiarity with the wine varietal also preferred the specific wine tag over the generic label. Differences in consumer psychographics appear to modulate front wine label preferences.},

Sometimes these two techniques are considered to be identical, but there is an important difference. Lemmatization is generally more utilizable, because it produces the basic word form which is required in many application areas (i.e. cross-language processing and machine translation). However, lemmatization is a difficult task - especially for highly inflected natural languages having a lot of words for the same normalized word form. We present a novel lemmatization algorithm which utilizes the multilingual semantic thesaurus Eurowordnet (EWN). We describe the algorithm in detail and compare it with other widely used algorithms for word normalization on two different corpora. We present promising results obtained by our EWN-based lemmatization approach in comparison to other techniques. We also discuss the influence of the word normalization on classification task in general. In overall, the performance of our method is good and it achieves similar precision and recall in comparison with other word normalization methods. However, our experiments indicate that word normalization does not affect the text classification task significantly.},

The results suggest that product separation by experts was mainly based on the perceived overall quality rather than on specific sensory differences. Product differentiation by consumers was poor and worse than that of experts and trained subjects. Consumers' internal preference map showed a good sample separation based on liking data and allowed the identification of the aroma attributes that drove their preferences. Results from consumer tests indicated that differences among samples based on liking data were more evident than those from Projective Mapping. An increased differentiation ability was observed for those consumers able to match the duplicate samples in the Projective Mapping test. In this group, sample differentiation based mainly on liking was observed. The socio-cognitive traits of these subjects highlighted their high level of wine knowledge.},

I use the notion of hybridity as a way of describing how local producers do not necessarily follow one specific production logic, whether of scale or variety. The research shows that they exchange, borrow, absorb, and appropriate practices, technologies, knowledge, and conventions from all available models of production. The nature and the extent of the exchange, and thus of hybridization, vary according to the nature of the product, to the position a particular firm occupies within the network, and ultimately, to individual and collective conceptions of how production can and should be organized. The specific ways that firms coordinate transactions between one another and how they develop relations with markets also reflect the producers' choices among different models of organization. Hybridity matters in relation to rural development policies. The entry of local food products into modern marketplaces through a series of intermediate steps, some modern, some traditional, opens up an opportunity to rethink the alleged opposition between industrial and artisan production within localized food networks. As I will show, between industrial and artisan producers, objectives may diverge, but there can also be strong positive exchange. Although industrial producers link up with buyers by serving increasingly wide, even global, markets, artisan producers help retain expertise within the territory of production, anchoring the product deeper into the culture, history, and geography of the area. Institutional actors should recognize and enhance such synergies apart and beyond the technical aspects of production.},

To explore these issues, the evolution is traced of three cases of regional food production, where local actors pursue the opportunity to qualify products under EEC Regulation 2081/92. The results reveal, in practice, the different experiences that can evolve under the same qualification mechanism, and also how the consequences for rural development can vary.

Genetic variation in human ORs is abundant and alters receptor function, allowing us to examine the relationship between receptor function and perception. We sequenced the OR repertoire in 332 individuals and examined how genetic variation affected 276 olfactory phenotypes, including the perceived intensity and pleasantness of 68 odorants at two concentrations, detection thresholds of three odorants, and general olfactory acuity. Genetic variation in a single OR was frequently associated with changes in odorant perception, and we validated 10 cases in which in vitro OR function correlated with in vivo odorant perception using a functional assay. In 8 of these 10 cases, reduced receptor function was associated with reduced intensity perception. In addition, we used participant genotypes to quantify genetic ancestry and found that, in combination with single OR genotype, age, and gender, we can explain between 10\% and 20\% of the perceptual variation in 15 olfactory phenotypes, highlighting the importance of single OR genotype, ancestry, and demographic factors in the variation of olfactory perception.},

  abstract = {What makes an individual, on any given occasion, able and willing to prepare a meal for themselves: that is, to cook? As home cooking has increasingly become the focus of public-health, nutrition, and policy interventions and campaigns, the need for a better understanding has become apparent. It is clear that cooking is not merely a matter of mechanical skill or rote training; beyond this, it is difficult to explain why similar individuals have such different capacities for setting and achieving food-related goals. This paper proposes a new paradigm for cooking and food provisioning e termed ``food agency'' e that attempts to describe how an individual's desires form and are enacted in correspondence with social environments: broadly, agency emerges from the complex interplay of individual technical skills and cognitive capacities with social and cultural supports and barriers. Drawing on a close reading of anthropological and sociological research into cooking, the authors propose that an individual's ability to integrate such complexity in regard to provisioning e to possess `food agency' e is crucial. This argument is supplemented by empirical case studies from a large body of ethnographic observations and interviews with home cooks from the United States, conducted over the last decade. Overall, more food agency means the cook is more empowered to act. Adopting the paradigm of food agency into the consideration of everyday cooking practices has the potential to support transdisciplinary food scholarship integrating individual actions within a food system and thus inform nutrition and public health interventions related to meal preparation.},

This prevalent term is broadly applied, although its core elements vary from initiative to initiative. In light of its ubiquitous use\textemdash but varying definitions\textemdash this article establishes the scope of food literacy research by identifying all articles that define `food literacy', analysing its key conceptualizations, and reporting outcomes/measures of this concept. A scoping review was conducted to identify all articles (academic and grey literature) using the term ``food literacy''. Databases included Medline, Pubmed, Embase, CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Scopus, JSTOR, and Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Of 1049 abstracts, 67 studies were included. From these, data was extracted on country of origin, study type (methodological approach), primary target population, and the primary outcomes relating to food literacy. The majority of definitions of food literacy emphasize the acquisition of critical knowledge (information and understanding) (55\%) over functional knowledge (skills, abilities and choices) (8\%), although some incorporate both (37\%). Thematic analysis of 38 novel definitions of food literacy reveals the prevalence of six themes: skills and behaviours, food/health choices, culture, knowledge, emotions, and food systems. Study outcomes largely focus on knowledge generating measures, with very few focusing on health related outcome measures. Current definitions of food literacy incorporate components of six key themes or domains and attributes of both critical and functional knowledge. Despite this broad definition of the term, most studies aiming to improve food literacy focus on knowledge related outcomes. Few articles address health outcomes, leaving an important gap (and opportunity) for future research in this field.},

By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3\textendash 10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings11\textendash 13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure\textendash property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.},

  abstract = {Taste and Lively Matter in the Anthropocene  This paper is concerned with the role of taste in relation to food produced in backyard or community gardens. Taste, as outlined by Bourdieu, is constructed by many factors driven primarily by one's economic position as well as certain cultural influences. Such arguments tend to work against a na\"ive reading of the ``natural'' attributes of food and the biological impulses and responses humans have to taste. Instead, within these frameworks, taste is positioned as a product of the machinations of human society. Along these lines, it is generally accepted that the economic and, consequently, the social shaping of tastes today have been significantly impacted on by the rise of international agribusiness throughout the twentieth century. These processes have greatly reduced the varieties of food commercially available due to an emphasis on economies of scale that require the production of food that can be grown in monocultures and which can withstand long transport times (Norberg-Hodge, Thrupp, Shiva).   Of course, there are also other factors at play in relation to taste that give rise to distinction between classes. This includes the ways in which we perform our bodies and shape them in the face of our social and economic conditions. Many studies in this area focus on eating disorders and how control of food intake cannot be read simply as examples of disciplined or deviant bodies (Bordo, Probyn, Ferreday). Instead, the links between food and subjectivity are much more complex. However, despite the contradictions and nuance acknowledged in relation to understandings of food, it is primarily conceptualised as an economic and symbolic good that is controlled by humans and human informed processes.  In line with the above observations, literature on food provisioning choices in the areas of food sociology and human geography tends to focus on efforts to understand food purchasing decisions and eating habits. There is a strong political-economic dimension to this research even when its cultural-symbolic value is acknowledged. This is highlighted by the work of Julie Guthman which, among other things, explores ``the conversion of tastes into commodities (as well as the reverse)'' (``Commodified'' 296). Guthman's analysis of alternative food networks, particularly the organic sector and farmers markets, has tended to reaffirm a Bourdieuan understanding of class and distinction whereby certain foods become appropriated by elites, driving up price and removing it from the reach of ordinary consumers (``Commodified'', ``Fast Food'').   There has also been, however, some recognition of the limits of such approaches and acknowledgement of the fragility and porous nature of boundaries in the food arena. For example, Jordan points out in her study of the heirloom tomato that, even when a food is appropriated by elites, thereby significantly increasing its cost, consumption of the food and its cultural-symbolic meaning can continue unchanged by those who have traditionally produced and consumed the food privately in their gardens. Guthman is quite right to highlight the presence of huge inequities in both mainstream and alternative food systems throughout the world. Food may, however, be able to disrupt the dominance of these economic and social representations through its very own agentic qualities.   To explore this idea, this paper draws on the work of political theorist, Jane Bennett, and eco-feminist, Val Plumwood, and applies some of their key insights to data gathered through in-depth interviews with 20 community gardeners and 7 Canberra Show exhibitors carried out from 2009 to 2012. These interviews were approximately 1 to 2 hours long in duration and were carried out in, or following, an extensive tour of the gardens of the participants, during which tastings of the produce were regularly offered to the interviewers.  Jane Bennett sets out to develop a theoretical approach which she names ``thing-power materialism'' which is grounded in the idea that objects, including food, have agency (354). Bennett conceptualises this idea through her notion of ``lively matter'' and the ``thing power'' of objects which she defines as ``the curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle'' (``The force'' 351, ``Vibrant''). The basic idea here is that if we are willing to read agency into the nonhuman things around us, then we become forced to recognise that humans are simply one more element of a world of things which can act on, with or against others through various assemblages (Deleuze and Guatarri). These assemblages can be made, undone and rebuilt in multiple ways. The power of the elements to act within these may not be equal, but nor are they stable and static. For Bennett, this is not simply a return to previous materialist theories premised on na\"ive notions of object agency. It is, instead, a theory motivated by attempts to develop understandings and strategies that encourage engaged ecological living practices which seek to avoid ongoing human-inflicted environmental damage caused by the ``master rationality'' (Plumwood) that has fuelled the era of the anthropocene, the first geological era shaped by human action.   Anthropocentric thinking and its assumptions of human superiority and separateness to other elements of our ecological mesh (Morton ``Thinking'') has been identified as fuelling wasteful, exploitative, environmentally damaging practices. It acts as a key impediment to the embrace of attitudinal and behavioural changes that could promote more ecologically responsible and sustainable living practices. These ideas are particularly prominent in the fields of ecological humanities, ecological feminism and political theory (Bennett ``The force'', ``Vibrant''; Morton ``Ecological'', ``Thinking'', ``Ecology''; Plumwood). To redress these issues and reduce further human-inflicted environmental damage, work in these spaces tends to highlight the importance of identifying the interconnections and mutual reliance between humans and nonhumans in order to sustain life.   Thus, this work challenges the ``master rationality'' of the anthropocene by highlighting the agentic (Bennett ``The force,'' ``Vibrant'') or actant (Latour) qualities of nonhumans. In this spirit, Plumwood writes that we need to develop ``an environmental culture that values and fully acknowledges the nonhuman sphere and our dependency on it, and is able to make good decisions about how we live and impact on the nonhuman world'' (3). Food, as a basic human need, and its very gustatory taste, is animated by nonhuman elements. The role of these nonhumans is particularly visible to those who engage in their own gardening practices. As such, the ways in which gardeners understand and speak of these processes may provide insights into how an environmental culture as envisaged by Plumwood could be supported, harnessed and shared.   The brevity of this paper means only a quick skim of the murky ontological waters into which its wades can be provided. The overarching aim is to identify how the recent resurgence of cultural materiality can be linked to the ways in which everyday people conceptualise and articulate their food provisioning practices. In so doing, it demonstrates that gardeners can conceptualise their food, and the biological processes as well as the nonhuman labour which bring it to fruition, as having actant qualities. This is most overtly recognised through the gardeners' discussions of how their daily habits and routines alter in response to the qualities and ``needs'' of their food producing gardens. The gardeners do not express this in a strict nature/culture binary. Instead, they indicate an awareness of the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of the human and nonhuman worlds. In this way, understandings of ``taste,'' as produced by human centred relations predicated on exchange of capital, are being rethought. This rethinking may offer ways of promoting a more sustainable engagement with ecological beliefs and behaviours which work against the very notion of human dominance that produced the era of the anthropocene.  Local Food, Taste and Nonhuman Agency  Recent years have seen an increase in the purchasing, sale and growing of local food. This has materialised in multiple forms from backyard, verge and community gardens to the significant growth of farmers markets. Such shifts are attributed to increasing resistance to the privileging of globalised and industrial-scale agri-business, practices which highlight the ``master rationality'' underpinning the anthropocene. This backlash has been linked to environmental motivations (Seyfang ``Shopping,'' ``Ecological,'' ``Growing''); desires to support local economies (particularly the financial well-being of farmers) (Norberg-Hodge); and health concerns in relation to the use of chemicals in food production (Goodman and Goodman).   Despite evidence that people grow or buy food based on gustatory taste, this has received less overt attention as a motivator for food provisioning practices in the literature (Hugner). Where it is examined, taste is generally seen as a social/cultural phenomenon shaped by the ideas related to the environmental, economic and health concerns mentioned above. However, when consumers discuss taste they also refer to notions of freshness, the varieties of food that are available, and nostalgia for the ``way food used to be''.   Taste in its gustatory sense and pleasure from food consumption is alluded to in all of the interviews carried out for this research. While the reasons for gardening are multiple and varied, there is a common desire to produce food that tastes better and, thus, induces greater pleasure than purchased food. As one backyard gardener and successful Royal Canberra Show exhibitor notes: ``[e]verything that you put [grow] in the garden [has a] better taste than from the market or from the shop.'' The extent of this difference was often a surprise for the gardeners: ``I never knew a home grown potato could taste so different from a shop bought potato until I grew [my own] [\ldots ] and I couldn't believe the taste.''   The gardeners in this research all agreed that the taste of commercially available fruit and vegetables was inferior to self-produced food. This was attributed to the multiple characteristics of industrialised food systems. Participants referred specifically to issues ranging from reduction in the varieties available to the chemical intensive practices designed to lead to high yields in short periods of time. The resulting poor taste of such foods was exemplified by comments such as shop bought tomatoes ``don't taste like tomatoes'' and the belief that ``[p]otatoes and strawberries from the shop taste the same as each other''. Even when gardeners raised health concerns about mainstream food, emphasising their delight in growing their own because they ``knew what had gone into their food'' (Turner, ``Embodied''), the issue of taste continued to play an important role in influencing their gardening practices. One gardener stated: ``I prefer more [food that] is tasty than one that is healthy for me''. The tastiest food for her came from her own community garden plot and this motivated her to travel across town most days to tend the garden. While tasty food was often seen as being more nutritious, this was not the key driver in food production.  The superior taste of the fruit and vegetables grown by these gardeners in Canberra calls their bodies and minds into action to avoid poor tasting food. This desire for tasty food was viewed as common to the general population but was strongly identified as only being accessible to people who grow their own. A backyard gardener, speaking of the residents of an aged care facility where he volunteers observes: ``[w]hen you\ldots meet these people they've lost that ability to do any gardening and they really express it. They miss the taste, the flavours.'' Another backyard gardener and Show exhibitor recounted a story from two years prior when he and his wife invited guests for a New Year's Day lunch. While eating their meal, a guest asked ``did you grow these carrots?'' When he confirmed that he had, she declared: ``I can taste it.'' Others noted that many young people don't know what they are missing out on because they have never tasted home-grown produce.  Through the sense of taste, the tomatoes, potatoes and carrots and myriad of other foodstuffs grown at homes or in community gardens actively encourage resistance to, or questioning of, the industrial agricultural system and its outputs. The gardeners link poor tasting food to a loss of human responsiveness to plants resulting from the spatial characteristics of industrial agriculture. Modern agribusiness requires large-scale, global production and streamlined agricultural processes that aim to limit the need for producers to respond to unique climatic and soil conditions (through genetically modification technology, see Turner, ``Reflections'') and removes the need, and capacity, for individual care of plants. This has led to heavy reliance on agricultural chemicals.   The gardeners tend to link high-level usage of pesticides and herbicides with poor taste. One highly successful Show exhibitor, states that in his food, ``There's better taste \ldots because they haven't got the chemicals in them, not much spray, not much fertiliser, for that is better''. However, when chemical use is limited or removed, the gardeners acknowledge that food plants require more intensive and responsive human care. This involves almost daily inspection of individual plants to pick off and squash (or feed to chickens and birds) the harmful bugs.   The gardeners need to be vigilant and capable of developing innovative techniques to ensure the survival of their plants and the production of tasty food. They are, of course, not always successful. One organic community gardener lamented the rising populations of slaters and earwigs which could decimate whole beds of newly sprouted seedlings overnight. This was a common issue and, in response, the gardeners research and trial new methods of control (including encouraging the introduction of ``good'' bugs into the ecosystem through particular plantings). Ultimately, however, the gardeners were resigned to ``learn[ing] to live with them [the `bad' bugs]'' while exerting regular bodily and mental efforts to reduce their populations and maximise their own food production.  The lack of ultimate control over their growing patch, and the food it could produce, was acknowledged by the gardeners. There was an awareness and understanding of the role nonhuman elements play in food production, ranging from weather conditions to soil microbes to bugs. The gardeners talk of how their care-giving is responsive to these elements. As one community gardener asserts: ``\ldots we prefer to \ldots{} garden in a way that naturally strengthens the plant immune system.'' This involves regular attention to soil microbes and the practice of what was referred to as ``homeopathic'' gardening.   Through a responsive approach to the ``needs'' of plants, the soil, and other nonhuman elements, the plants then delivered ``vitamins and minerals'' to the gardeners, packaged in tasty food. The tastiest foods ensured their survival through seed-saving practices: ``[i]f something tastes good, we'll save the seed from it''. In this way, the plant's taste encourages gardeners to invest their human labour to secure its future. The production of tasty food was understood to be reliant on collaborative, iterative and ongoing efforts between human and nonhuman elements.  While gardening has often been represented as an attempt to bend nature to the will of humans (Power), the gardeners in this study spoke about working with nature in their quest to produce good tasting food. This was particularly evident in the interviews with gardeners who exhibit produce in the Canberra Show (see NMA for further details). However, despite the fact that taste is the key motivator for growing their own food, it is not a factor in Show judging. Instead, fruit and vegetable entries (those not turned into value added goods such as jams or relishes) are judged on appearance. While this focus on appearance tends to perpetuate the myth that the fruits and vegetables we consume should conform to an ideal type that are blemish free and uniform in size (just as is prized in industrialised agriculture), the act of gardening for the Show and the process of selecting produce to enter, contradicted this assumption.   Instead, entering the Show seemed to reinforce awareness of the limits of human control over nature and emphasise the very agency of nonhuman elements. This is highlighted by one exhibitor and community gardener who states:  I suppose you grow vegetables for the enjoyment of eating them, but there's also that side of getting enough and perfecting the vegetables and getting\ldots{} sometimes it's all down to the day of whether you've got three of something, if it's the right size and colour and so I'll enter it [in the Show] on the day instead of putting an entry form in before \ldots you just don't know what you're going to have, the bugs decide to eat this or the mice get it or something. There's always something.  In this way, where ``there's always something'' waiting to disrupt a gardener's best laid plans, the exhibitors involved in this project seem to be acutely aware of the agency of nonhumans. In these interviews there is evidence that nonhuman elements act on the gardeners, forcing them to alter their behaviours and engage with plants to meet both of their needs. While perfect specimens can sometimes be grown for the Show, the gardeners acknowledge that this can only be done with an element of luck and careful cultivation of the partnership between human and nonhuman elements in the garden. And, even then, you never know what might happen. This lack of ultimate control is part of the challenge and, thus, the appeal, of competing in the Show.  Conclusion  The era of the anthropocene demonstrates the consequences of human blindness to ecological matters. Myths of human supremacy and a failure to respect nonhuman elements have fuelled a destructive and wasteful mentality that is having serious consequences for our environment. This has prompted efforts to identify new environmental cultures to promote the adoption of more sustainable lifestyles. The resurgence of cultural materialism and the agentic capacity of objects is one key way in which this is being explored as a means of promoting new ethical approaches to how humans live their lives enmeshed with nonhumans. Food, as a basic necessity, provides a key way in which the interconnected relationships between humans and nonhumans can be brought to the fore. Taste, as a biological response and organic attribute of foodstuffs, can induce humans to act. It can cause us to alter our daily habits, behaviours and beliefs. Perhaps a more attentive approach to food, its taste and how it is produced could provide a framework for rethinking human/nature relations by emphasising the very limits of human control.

The term itself is increasingly recognized as a negative pole, while the label of ``natural'' is exploited as guarantee of healthiness in marketing food campaigns. This article takes issue with the natural/artificial debate by emphasizing the aesthetic side of artificial flavorings \textendash{} chemical substances designed to alter or enhance the taste of processed foods. Here, I reconsider the conception of artificiality as a poor imitation of nature and instead underline the link between technology and aesthetics, by examining the practice of flavorists. Through ethnographic detail I call for moving the synthetic out of the``inauthentic''and argue that the attempt to mimic natural flavors through synthesis is not only an act of imitation and resemblance (as critics exclusively contend) but can also be thought as an act of representation and interpretation (as my fieldwork illuminates).},

The research objective was to build an odor classification based on internal knowledge (i.e. mental context). Twelve floral scents were described freely by 60 participants. First, three sensory judges undertook a semantic analysis of the 1145 olfactory terms gathered. Secondly, a study of the entailment between olfactory properties was conducted using 42 subjects working on four lists of terms describing the characteristics of floral perfumes. The results confirmed the hypothesis that olfactory properties show tree-like structure. This allowed us to propose a classification system composed of two superordinate categories: First, objects, being olfactory sources, constitute the first category and are considered as olfactory properties themselves (i.e. civilization, food and natural sources). Second non-objects properties are those applicable to a diversity of objects: (i.e. properties, such as objects' physical state: sensory, intensity, space, time) and those related to the subject (as personal feelings and value judgments). Based on these results, it appears that olfactory properties can be organized as a semantic network in line with the general theory of categorization.},

Sixteen wine professionals (`experts') and 16 wine consumers in New Zealand organised 67 experimenter-provided descriptors of Sauvignon blanc wine by building an hierarchical tree with the sensory properties (see Urdapilleta, Giboreau, Manetta, Houix, \& Richard, 2006). Each participant organised the Sauvignon blanc sensory properties under two conditions, a Semantic condition (memory-based) and a Perceptive condition (experiential). The Perceptive condition followed the Semantic condition and involved participants tasting three Sauvignon blanc wines, previously rated high in typicality (see Parr, Green, White, \& Sherlock, 2007), prior to organising the wine sensory properties. This condition contrasted with the Semantic condition in which participants formed the hierarchical classification of the provided wine terms from memory. We employed a model described by Schlich (1994) to interpret the data and explore consistency within and between participants. Results showed that experts and wine consumers overall organised the wine sensory properties in similar ways, but that wine consumers were less homogeneous in their classifications, demonstrating that they lacked the shared cognitive constructs relating to Sauvignon blanc wine knowledge exhibited by the experts. Further, wine experts performed similarly across conditions, demonstrating an ability to conceptualise Sauvignon blanc from memory in much the same way that they conceptualised the wines when experiencing (i.e., tasting) exemplars. On the other hand, wine consumers' hierarchical classifications differed across conditions. The results are discussed in terms of the cognitive processing associated with developed wine knowledge.},

Results: One fourth of participants described their cooking skills as very adequate at 18\textendash 23 years, with no statistically significant differences by sociodemographic characteristics. Reports of very adequate cooking skills at age 18\textendash 23 years predicted better nutrition-related outcomes 10 years later, such as more frequent preparation of meals including vegetables (P {$<$} .001) and less frequent fast food consumption (P {$<$} .001). Conclusions and Implications: Developing adequate cooking skills by emerging adulthood may have long-term benefits for nutrition over a decade later. Ongoing and new interventions to enhance cooking skills during adolescence and emerging adulthood are warranted but require strong evaluation designs that observe young people over a number of years.},

We illustrate the variation of factors affecting our food preferences; biological/physiological, psychological and societal factors. Second, we aim to give a general overview over factors affecting food choice and the actual decision making process used by consumers. Third, we provide a brief discussion regarding the connection between food preferences and food choice. Finally, we conclude by stating that further insight is needed in areas such as cultural, historical and demographic factors.

We compared the memory performance of ``beer experts'' and novices in two recognition tasks. The first task was performed ortho- and retronasally with beers, and the second orthonasally with beer odor compounds. As a control we also compared the performance of ``experts'' and novices on an identification task and a same/different discrimination task. ``Beer experts'' outperformed novices in both the identification task and the recognition memory task with both beers and odor compounds, but only for beers they had been trained on (familiar beers), and regardless of the type of odors (familiar vs. unfamiliar). ``Experts'' were only marginally superior in the beer discrimination task. This suggests that the experts' advantage in recognition memory is likely to have its source in more efficient coding and retrieval in long-term memory, rather than in better perceptual ability. No significant correlation was found between odor and beer memory performance, which suggests that, during training, ``experts'' might develop independent memory structures for odor compounds and for beers.},

Involving children in food preparation could be an opportunity to develop healthy eating behaviors and to increase vegetable consumption. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of children's involvement in meal preparation on their food and vegetable intake. A between-subject experiment was conducted with 47 children aged 6 to 10 years. In condition 1 (n = 25), children prepared a lunch meal (pasta, breaded chicken, cauliflower, and salad) with the assistance of a parent. In condition 2 (n = 22), the meal was prepared by the parent alone. Independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare intake in the ``child cooks'' and ``parent cooks'' conditions. Children in the child cooks condition ate significantly more salad 41.7 g (76.1\%), more chicken 21.8 g (27.0\%), and more calories 84.6 kcal (24.4\%) than children in the parent cooks condition. Between before cooking and directly after cooking the meal, children in the child cooks condition reported significantly increased feelings of valence (feeling positive) and dominance (feeling in control). This study confirms that involving children in meal preparation can increase vegetable intake. Because of the potential effect on energy intake, parents need to be made aware of appropriate portion sizes for their children. Taking this into account, encouraging parents to involve their children in the preparation of healthy and balanced meals could be a valuable intervention strategy to improve the diets and vegetable intake of children. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For medical nutrition products (MNP) the textural properties also contribute to both swallowing efficiency and safety, therefore impacting the nutrition and fluid intake of individuals in need of adapted textures (e.g. dysphagia, poor dental status). The need for an international terminology in a medical context has been expressed through several initiatives. The main reason was the inconsistency in mouthfeel terminology usage per country and care provider. A consistent terminology is important when selecting and preparing a safe and acceptable MNP. Current terminology is not specific to MNP, making it challenging to develop optimal MNP and communicating about them. The objective of the current study was to develop a hierarchically structured mouthfeel terminology suited to MNP. This terminology was developed with expert sensory panelists describing the mouthfeel terminology of 32 products, resulting in 9 umbrella terms and 51 individual attributes. To categorize the terminology appropriately and to make it accessible to a wide range of users, Taxonomic Free Sorting (TFS) was used to develop a hierarchical structure which is represented as a wheel. This structured terminology should assist sensory expert panels, Health Care Professionals (HCP), carers, individuals in need of adapted textures, chefs, food technologists and sensory scientists in their interpretation and use of terminology related to mouthfeel of MNP. Ultimately the mouthfeel wheel was developed as a communication tool to support product improvement and selection of MNP by HCP, with an optimized mouthfeel for individuals in need of adapted textures.},

In this review, the four major methods for gas chromatography-olfactometry are described and their potentials and limitations discussed. The methods include dilution analysis, detection frequency methods, posterior intensity methods and time-intensity methods. The value of gas chromatography olfactometry data is shown to depend directly on the gas chromatography-olfactometry method, as well as on sample preparation and analytical conditions. Each of the methods has been used frequently and has its advantages and disadvantages. However, on the methodological side, a considerable area is still to be explored, which would contribute to the interpretation of the data and would improve the value of these techniques for both fundamental and applied research. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Considering the economic and time consuming aspects of training assessor panels for descriptive analysis, several novel methodologies for sensory characterization have been developed in the last ten years. These methodologies are less time consuming, more flexible and can be used with semi trained assessors and even consumers, providing sensory maps very close to a classic descriptive analysis with highly trained panels. Novel techniques are based on different approaches: methods based on the evaluation of individual attributes (intensity scales, check-all-that-apply questions or CATA, flash profiling, paired comparisons); methods based on the evaluation of global differences (sorting, projective mapping or Napping (R)); methods based on the comparison with product references (polarized sensory positioning), and based on a free, global evaluation of the individual products (Open-ended questions). This review aims at reviewing theory, implementation, advantages and disadvantages of the novel product profiling techniques developed in the last ten years, discussing recommendations for their application.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study, by combining sensory and experimental economics techniques, aims to analyse to what extent the production process, and the information about it, may affect consumer preferences. Sparkling wines produced by Champenoise and Charmat methods were the object of the study. A quantitative descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel and non-hypothetical auctions combined with hedonic ratings involving young wine consumers (N = 100), under different information scenarios (Blind, Info and Info Taste), were performed. RESULTS: The findings show that the production process impacts both the sensory profile of sparkling wines and consumer expectations. In particular, the hedonic ratings revealed that when tasting the products, both with no information on the production process (Blind) and with such information (Info Taste), the consumers preferred the Charmat wines. On the contrary, when detailed information on the production methods was given without tasting (Info), consumers liked the two Champenoise wines more. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that sensory and non-sensory attributes of sparkling wines affect consumers' preferences. Specifically, the study suggests that production process information strongly impacts liking expectations, while not affecting informed liking.},

We report two experiments designed to investigate whether multisensory atmospheric cues could be used to influence the perception of a glass of whisky (that is, a complex but familiar product). The pre-test (experiment 1) was conducted in the laboratory and involved a sample of 18 participants (12 females, 5 males, and 1 who did not specify gender), while the main study (experiment 2) was conducted at a large purpose-designed whisky-tasting event held in London, and enrolled a sample of 441 participants (165 female, 250 male, and 26 who failed to specify their gender). In the main experiment, participants were exposed to three different multisensory atmospheres/rooms, and rated various attributes of the whisky (specifically the nose, the taste/flavor, and the aftertaste) in each room.RESULTS:Analysis of the data showed that each multisensory atmosphere/room exerted a significant effect on participants' ratings of the attributes that the atmosphere/room had been designed to emphasize (namely grassiness, sweetness, and woodiness). Specifically, the whisky was rated as being significantly grassier in the Nose ('grassy') room, as being significantly sweeter in the Taste ('sweet') room, and as having a significantly woodier aftertaste in the Finish ('woody') room. Overall, the participants preferred the whisky when they tasted it in the Finish room.CONCLUSIONS:Taken together, these results further our understanding of the significant influence that a multisensory atmosphere can have on people's experience and/or enjoyment of a drink (in this case, a glass of whisky). The implications of these results for the future design of multisensory experiences are discussed.},

Analyses confirm that involvement in meat is a multidimensional construct including four facets: pleasure value, symbolic value, risk importance and risk probability. Four involvement-based meat consumer segments are identified: straightforward, cautious, indifferent, and concerned. Socio-demographic differences between the segments relate to gender, age and presence of children. The segments differ in terms of extensiveness of the decision-making process, impact and trust in information sources, levels of concern, price consciousness, claimed meat consumption, consumption intention, and preferred place of purchase. The two segments with a strong perception of meat risks constitute two-thirds of the market. They can be typified as cautious meat lovers versus concerned meat consumers. Efforts aiming at consumer reassurance through quality improvement, traceability, labelling or communication may gain effectiveness when targeted specifically to these two segments. Whereas straightforward meat lovers focus mainly on taste as the decisive criterion, indifferent consumers are strongly price oriented.},

Priming environmental values enhanced attention to and the weight of information related to those values, which resulted in environmentally friendly consumer choices. This only occurred if these values were central to the self-concept. Value-congruent choices were also found in response to countervalue behavior in an unrelated context. Donating behavior congruent with central altruistic values was found as a result of enhanced self-focus, thus demonstrating the importance of the self in the value-behavior relation. The external validity of the value-centrality measure and its distinction from attitudes were demonstrated in the prediction of voting. Values were thus found to give meaning to, energize, and regulate value-congruent behavior, but only if values were cognitively activated and central to the self.

Therefore, research has examined the possibility of working with the check-all-that-apply (CATA) method, which is quite easy to use, especially given the lack of scaling. However, the question arises as to what extent the CATA questions bear additional information compared to the hedonic assessment for food choice prediction. Therefore, this study examined the value of CATA questions for predicting actual food choice for 149 children (aged 11\textendash 13 years) using five biscuits. The data showed that including CATA questions resulted in significantly better prediction of actual food choice. Moreover, the CATA questions provided discriminating sensory profiles for the samples, and this method was even able to discriminate between similarly-liked samples.},

The present work aims to provide an insight on the minimum number of consumers needed to reach stable sample configurations. Data sets from 21 different consumer studies, differing in product category, number of samples and degree of difference among them, were used to evaluate the influence of the number of consumers on the stability of sample configurations by means of a resampling approach. For each study, 1000 random subsets of different number of consumers were generated from the original data set. For each virtual panel, sample configurations were obtained using Multiple Factor Analysis. The agreement between them and the reference configurations (obtained with all the consumers) was evaluated through the RV coefficient, using the first two and the first four dimensions of the MFA. Results showed that the stability of sample configuration clearly depended on the degree of difference and type of differences among samples and the number of samples in the dataset. Across the 21 data sets analysed, results suggested that when working with widely different samples, 50 consumers seems as a safe recommendation of minimum consumer panel size to obtain reliable results with projective mapping. However, after any characterisation by projective mapping is completed, it is highly recommended to check, a posteriori, the reliability of the sample space configuration using a bootstrapping procedure.},

The stability of product spaces was evaluated using a bootstrapping resampling approach. Both experimental conditions had a small but positive impact as evidenced by small increases in average RV coefficients across simulations. Additionally, in studies using projective mapping, the confidence ellipses around sample positions were smaller than those established in product spaces with the base group of consumers.

  abstract = {The aim of the present work was to explore the potential of Biterm Topic Modelling (BTM) for analysing responses to open-ended survey questions in the pursuit of consumer insights. The selection of BTM was based on its suitability to the analysis of short texts compared to other approaches such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The empirical context was vertical farming (VF), which participants read a short text about and then answered a question about interest in buying fruits and vegetables from VF. The data came from US consumers (n~=~1803) who provided answers with a median length of 9 words. Results were promising about the potential of BTM to uncover latent topics from responses to open-ended questions. The models predicted coherent and consistent topics relating to VF, including buying VF produce or not and year-round fruit and vegetable supply. Two variants of the text about VF were used (n~{$\sim~$}900 per variant), and BTM models trained on responses to the variant which emphasised the possibility of using genetic engineering in VF consistently predicted topics related to genetic engineering.

  abstract = {Food literacy has emerged as a term to describe the everyday practicalities associated with healthy eating. The term is increasingly used in policy, practice, research and by the public; however, there is no shared understanding of its meaning. The purpose of this research was to develop a definition of food literacy which was informed by the identification of its components. This was considered from two perspectives: that of food experts which aimed to reflect the intention of existing policy and investment, and that of individuals, who could be considered experts in the everyday practicalities of food provisioning and consumption. Given that food literacy is likely to be highly contextual, this second study focused on disadvantaged young people living in an urban area who were responsible for feeding themselves. The Expert Study used a Delphi methodology (round one n = 43). The Young People's Study used semi-structured, life-course interviews (n = 37). Constructivist Grounded Theory was used to analyse results. This included constant comparison of data within and between studies. From this, eleven components of food literacy were identified which fell into the domains of: planning and management; selection; preparation; and eating. These were used to develop a definition for the term ``food literacy''.},

A methodological point of view is mainly adopted to describe as simply as possible the construction of binary decision trees and, more precisely, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), as well as the generation of an ensemble of trees or, in other words, a Random Forest. The interest of the permutation accuracy criterion, as a measure of variable importance, is specifically emphasized as a way of identifying the most predictive variables and selecting a subset of these variables for parsimonious and efficient predictive models. A two-step procedure is proposed for choosing this subset of variables. The principle of the method is illustrated in a case study in which the aim was to better understand and predict the olfactory characteristics of red wines made of the Cabernet Franc grape variety, from their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) content. For two main olfactory attributes, the bell pepper odor and the leather odor, it was possible to list the most important compounds and to highlight a very small number of compounds useful for estimating each of the olfactory attributes considered. For the latter, it was also observed that Random Forest models had a better predictive ability than Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression models.},

This paper analyzes the sales of tin cans (pate\^As) as well as explores the effect of the product brand on sales. The main conclusions of the paper are that consumers do not value products based exclusively on their physical characteristics and that in the process of making a purchasing decision when choosing an alternative, consumers will first perceive the brand as ``a sign of quality'' and then other evaluation criteria (physical appearance and packaging, price, the reputation of the retail network).},

Analyzing facial expressions as an implicit measurement may provide a better understanding of consumers' preferences at a subconscious level by capturing their objective responses to products after tasting. Therefore, the present proof of concept study investigated facial expressions among beer consumers while tasting beer samples. The first objective was to examine the feasibility of a newly developed measurement protocol for capturing facial expressions for analysis. The second objective was to determine possible indices that may be able to predict the choice of beers after tasting. A total of 151 Japanese beer consumers who took part in two tests (n~=~50 and n~=~101, respectively) tasted three beer samples. The participants were video-recorded throughout the taste tests, and 10~s of video were extracted for each sample to analyze facial expressions during the tasting using an automated facial expression analyzer. Instead of directly asking about liking, choice behavior was measured after each participant tasted all three beer samples. The results suggested that measuring facial expressions during beer tasting is a feasible method that provides adequate data for effective analysis. The results also indicated the possibility of creating effective indices of facial expressions to predict the choice of beers after tasting, and that the ``Lip suck'' and ``Lip press'' expressions contributed negatively and positively to beer choices, respectively.},

  abstract = {Although sweeteners are widely used additives in beverages, taste interaction between sweeteners and minerals in water is rarely reported. The objective was to investigate the influence of different concentrations of iron and water hardness on taste perception of sweetened beverages and characterize the corresponding emotional profiles. Taste interaction was developed by dissolving five natural and artificial sweeteners [sucrose, honey, sucralose, saccharin, and acesulfame potassium (ace-K)] into four synthetic waters [soft water (0 mg Fe/L), moderate hard water (0.3 mg Fe/L), hard water (1 mg Fe/L) and very hard water (3 mg Fe/L)], respectively. Sweet and metallic taste intensity of different combinations were compared by pairwise ranking tests. Acceptability and emotional response on sucrose sweetened beverage with and without the addition of iron was evaluated by 9-point hedonic score test and check-all-thatapply emotional term ballot. Iron (Fe2+) created metallic flavor in drinking water and produced bored and disgusted feelings for consumers. Other minerals such as Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ at subthresholds impacted taste perception of water. Sweetness of sweeteners was varied with different concentrations of minerals in water and with different types of sweeteners. High concentration of iron and water hardness significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.05) the sweetness of sucrose, honey and ace-K. Sweet-metallic taste interaction between sucrose and ferrous ions significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) increased the acceptance of very hard water (3 mg Fe/L), and created a unique emotional profile- ``mild''. Distribution of emotional profiles could be different between samples with the same hedonic scores and provide more in-depth information than acceptance test.},

Methods and Results: Three young single varietal wines, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and three 50\textendash 50 blends of these were used. Eighty-seven participants, comprising three expertise levels, tasted all six wines blind, then rated the perceived complexity, liking, intensity, familiarity, quality, and willingness to pay, as well as listing five flavour descriptors that best matched each wine. Linguistic analysis on the choice of flavour descriptors by participants revealed that greater complexity was associated with winemaking flavours, especially oak. Further analysis demonstrated that complexity was not independently correlated with willingness to pay, but was predicted by a combination of perceived attributes (quality, liking) as well as participant expertise. Conclusions: Wine complexity was revealed as a multi-faceted concept that involved the perceived attributes in the wine (quality, intensity, liking) as well as being influenced by participant background (age, gender) and even by environmental context (specifically the order in which the wines were tasted).},

This study examined how low-income adults who had primary responsibility for household food purchases considered retail produce decisions. We used a qualitative research approach based on grounded theory and an ecological conceptual framework. Twenty-eight low-income rural, village, and inner city heads of households in upstate New York, USA, were selected by purposive and theoretical sampling and interviewed about fruit and vegetable shopping habits, attitudes toward local food stores, and where and how they would prefer to buy produce. Analyses revealed their concerns were organized around five themes: store venue; internal store environment; product quality; product price; relationships with the stores. An unanticipated finding was the differing social relations that appear to exist between participant consumers, store employees and management, and the store itself as a representation of the larger retail food system. Attitudes toward retail food stores in this study are described as passive or fatalistic indifference, supportive, opportunistic, and confrontational (change agents). These attitudes are related to how shoppers considered retail fruit and vegetable choice, access, and availability. These findings suggest ways to individualize nutrition education and consumer education messages.},

This paper examines how these actors are produced by changes in the global economy that are sometimes referred to as neoliberalism. It also shows how images of these actors are produced and what the material effects of those images are. It begins with a description of how generations are understood and made by marketers. Next it shows how coffee production in Papua New Guinea, especially Fair Trade and organic coffee production, is turned into marketing narratives meant to appeal to particular consumers. Finally, it assesses the success of the generational-based marketing of Papua New Guinea-origin, Fair Trade and organic coffees, three specialty coffee types that are marketed heavily to the ``Millenial generation'', people born between 1983 and 2000.},

The distinction between short- and long-term memory in other sensory modalities has been generally supported by three main lines of evidence: capacity differences between the proposed systems, evidence of differential coding, and differential memory losses in neuropsychological patients. The present paper examines these issues in an effort to establish a similar distinction for the memory of olfactory stimuli. Each of these lines of evidence is examined in relation to the literature on olfactory memory. Based on this examination, it seems that there is at least preliminary support from each of these lines of evidence to advocate a distinction between a long- and short-term memory for olfactory stimuli. Emphasis is placed upon the qualitative similarity of olfactory memory to other memory systems. This similarity is further highlighted through an examination of the literature pertinent to serial position effects in memory for olfactory stimuli.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

Using experimental and questionnaire-based designs, these studies place an emphasis on individual consumption and cognitive appraisal, overlooking the interactive context in which food is eaten. The current article examines eating practices in a more naturalistic environment, using mealtime conversations tape-recorded by families at home. The empirical data highlight three issues concerning the discursive construction of eating practices, which raise problems for the existing methodologies. These are: (1) how the nature and evaluation of food are negotiable qualities; (2) the use of participants' physiological states as rhetorical devices; and (3) the variable construction of norms of eating practices. The article thus challenges some key assumptions in the dominant literature and indicates the virtues of an approach to eating practices using interactionally based methodologies.},

  abstract = {Off-flavors in foods may originate from environmental pollutants, the growth of microorganisms, oxidation of lipids, or endogenous enzymatic decomposition in the foods. The chromatographic analysis of flavors and off-flavors in foods usually requires that the samples first be processed to remove as many interfering compounds as possible. For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization. Headspace GC analysis of orange juice, fish, dehydrated potatoes, and milk requires almost no sample preparation. Purge-and-trap GC analysis of dairy products, seafoods, and garlic may require heating, microwave-mediated distillation, purging the sample with inert gases and trapping the analytes with Tenax or C18, thermal desorption, cryofocusing, or elution with ethyl acetate. Solid-phase microextraction GC analysis of spices, milk and fish can involve microwave-mediated distillation, and usually requires adsorption on poly(dimethyl)siloxane or electrodeposition on fibers followed by thermal desorption. For short-path thermal desorption GC analysis of spices, herbs, coffee, peanuts, candy, mushrooms, beverages, olive oil, honey, and milk, samples are placed in a glass-lined stainless steel thermal desorption tube, which is purged with helium and then heated gradually to desorb the volatiles for analysis. Few of the methods that are available for analysis of food flavors and off-flavors can be described simultaneously as cheap, easy and good.  2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of sodium salts as bitterness suppressors is highly variable depending on the tastants used, and few studies have investigated whether salt can mask the bitterness of nutritious vegetables. We compared how sodium chloride (NaCl) affected bitterness ratings of vegetables and quinine hydrochloride (QHCl). In Experiment 1, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower were rated plain and with the addition of NaCl on hedonic and sensory attributes. In Experiment 2, multiple concentrations of NaCl were given on the vegetables, and participants tasted QHCl plain and with the addition of NaCl. In both experiments, reported bitterness and liking of the vegetables did not change with the addition of NaCl; all p values{$>$}0.3. Hierarchical linear regression modeling revealed that NaCl decreased the bitterness ratings of the vegetables most for participants who perceived the plain vegetables as highly bitter, R 2=0.211, and increased hedonic ratings of the vegetables most for participants who disliked the plain vegetables, R 2=0.243. The addition of NaCl to QHCl significantly reduced bitterness ratings, p {$<$}0.001, especially for participants who found the plain QHCl highly bitter, R 2=0.339. Sodium chloride suppressed bitterness and increased liking for participants who disliked plain vegetables and tasted them as highly bitter. These results suggest that NaCl would be efficacious as a bitterness masking agent for people particularly vulnerable to vegetable underconsumption. Furthermore, NaCl might interact fundamentally differently with a full food matrix than it does with QHCl, limiting the generalizeability of chemical suppression studies.},

Variety increases the amount of food consumed in test of ad libitum intake. However, outside the laboratory, meals are often planned in advance and then consumed in their entirety. We sought to explore the extent to which the variety effect is anticipated in this pre-meal planning. Participants were shown two food images, each representing a first or a second course of a hypothetical meal. The two courses were either, (i) exactly the same food, (ii) different foods from the same sensory category (sweet or savoury), or (iii) different foods from a different sensory category. In Study 1 (N = 30) these courses comprised typical `main meal' foods and in Study 2 (N = 30) they comprised snack foods. For each pair of images, participants rated their expected liking of the second course and selected ideal portion sizes, both for the second course and the first and second course, combined. In both studies, as the difference between the courses (from (i) same to (ii) similar to (iii) different) increased, the second course was selected in a larger portion and it was rated as more pleasant. To our knowledge, these are the first studies to show that the variety effect is evident in the energy content of self-selected meals. This work shows that effects of variety are learned and anticipated. This extends our characterisation beyond a passive process that develops towards the end of a meal.},

Before this can be accomplished it is essential to have detailed knowledge of the volatile and non-volatile constituents of cider, the contribution these components make to the flavour, the bio-synthetic pathways by which they are formed and the factors which affect the amounts produced. Research has already provided much analytical information and the use of threshold values enables useful data to be obtained on their flavour contribution. The approach of correlating taste panel data obtained on the cider in its entirety with the analytical data offers a means of supplementing this informaion. Our present knowledge of the biochemistry of cider components and the effect of environmental factors, together with information which can be drawn from other fields, encourages the belief that cider flavour could be controlled to a much greater degree than it is at present.},

Previously, TFS has been used for the visual assessment of packaging whereas this study extends the range of potential uses of the technique to incorporate full sensory analysis by the target consumer, which, when combined with hedonic liking scores, was used to generate a novel preference map. Furthermore, to fully evaluate the efficacy of using the sorting method, the technique was evaluated with a healthy older adult consumer group. Participants sorted eight products into groups and described their reason at each stage as they combined those groups, producing a consumer-specific vocabulary. This vocabulary was combined with hedonic data from a separate group of older adults, to give the external preference map. Taxonomic sorting is a simple, fast and effective method for use with older adults, and its combination with liking data can yield a preference map constructed entirely from target consumer data.},

We examined the semantics of these smell terms in 3 experiments (exemplar listing, similarity judgment and off-line rating). The exemplar listing task confirmed that Maniq smell terms have complex meanings encoding smell qualities. Analyses of the similarity data revealed that the odor lexicon is coherently structured by two dimensions. The underlying dimensions are pleasantness and dangerousness, as verified by the off-line rating study. Ethnographic data illustrate that smell terms have detailed semantics tapping into broader cultural constructs. Contrary to the widespread view that languages cannot encode odors, the Maniq data show odor can be a coherent semantic domain, thus shedding new light on the limits of language.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine national patterns in cooking frequency and diet quality among adults in the USA, overall and by weight-loss intention. Design: Analysis of cross-sectional 24 h dietary recall and interview data. Diet quality measures included total kilojoules per day, grams of fat, sugar and carbohydrates per day, fast-food meals per week, and frozen/pizza and ready-toeat meals consumed in the past 30 d. Multivariable regression analysis was used to test associations between frequency of cooking dinner per week (low (0\textendash 1), medium (2\textendash 5) and high (6\textendash 7)), dietary outcomes and weight-loss intention. Setting: The 2007\textendash 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Subjects: Adults aged 20 years and over (n 9569). Results: In 2007\textendash 2010, 8 \% of adults lived in households in which someone cooked dinner 0\textendash 1 times/week and consumed, on an average day, 9627 total kilojoules, 86 g fat and 135 g sugar. Overall, compared with low cookers (0\textendash 1 times/week), a high frequency of cooking dinner (6\textendash 7 times/week) was associated with lower consumption of daily kilojoules (9054 v. 9627 kJ, P = 0{$\cdot$}002), fat (81 v. 86 g, P = 0{$\cdot$}016) and sugar (119 v. 135 g, P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). Individuals trying to lose weight consumed fewer kilojoules than those not trying to lose weight, regardless of household cooking frequency (2111 v. 2281 kJ/d, P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}006). Conclusions: Cooking dinner frequently at home is associated with consumption of a healthier diet whether or not one is trying to lose weight. Strategies are needed to encourage more cooking among the general population and help infrequent cookers better navigate the food environment outside the home.},

We aimed to examine perceptions of cooking and their association with cooking confidence, attitudes and behaviours in the USA. Design: We designed and fielded a nationally representative survey among US adults (n 1112) in April 2015. We used factor analysis to identify perceptions about cooking and multivariate ordered logit and Poisson models to explore associations between those perceptions and cooking confidence, attitudes and behaviours. Setting: Nationally representative web-based survey of US adults. Subjects: US adults aged {$\geq$}18 years. Results: Americans conceptualized cooking in three ways: the use of scratch ingredients, convenience foods and not using heat. Respondents who perceived cooking as including convenience foods were less confident in their ability to cook from scratch (OR = 0{$\cdot$}52, P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001) and less likely to enjoy cooking (OR = 0{$\cdot$}68, P = 0{$\cdot$}01) than those who did not. Although individuals who perceived cooking as including only scratch ingredients reported cooking dinner (4{$\cdot$}31 times/ week) and using packaged/boxed products (0{$\cdot$}95 times/week) the least frequently, few notable differences in the frequency of cooking meals were observed. Conclusions: Cooking frequency is similar among US adults regardless of how they perceive cooking, but cooking confidence and enjoyment are lowest among Americans who perceive cooking as including the use of convenience foods. These insights should inform the development of more specific measures of cooking behaviour as well as meaningful and targeted public health messages to encourage healthier cooking.},

The objective of this study was to describe perceptions of cooking and factors important to how cooking is perceived and practiced among American adults. Seven focus groups (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 53; 39 female; 35 Black, 16 White, 2 Asian) were conducted from November 2014 to January 2015 in Baltimore City, Maryland. Participants were recruited from two neighborhoods; one with higher median income and access to healthy food and the other with lower income and low access to healthy food. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Participants' perceptions of cooking varied considerably, regardless of neighborhood income or food access, and spanned a continuum from all scratch cooking to anything made at home. Perceptions of cooking incorporated considerations of whether or how food was heated and the degree of time, effort and love involved if convenience foods were used. Key barriers to cooking included affordability, lack of time, and lack of enjoyment. Key facilitators of frequent cooking included extensive organization and time management to enable participants to incorporate cooking into their daily lives. Cooking is a complex concept and not uniformly understood. Efforts to encourage healthy cooking at home should consider the broad spectrum of activities Americans recognize as cooking as well as the barriers and facilitators to preparing food at home. Public health messages to encourage more frequent cooking should account for the heterogeneity in perspectives about cooking. More research should explore differences in perceptions about cooking in other diverse populations.},

In 2018, we used Amazon TurkPrime to field two large national surveys in the United States (US) to examine food agency and several food- and cooking-related factors. The first survey (n = 1,457) was fielded in a national sample of US adults. The second survey (n = 1,399) comprised of parents of 2\textendash 9-year-old children. Analyses included hierarchical linear regression to examine factors that explained variation in food agency and used Poisson and generalized linear models to examine the association between food agency and between cooking behavior and dietary intake, respectively. Cooking skills; food skills; and cooking confidence, attitudes, and perceptions explained a high degree of food agency variance. Higher food agency was associated with more frequent cooking of all meals, more frequent scratch cooking, and less frequent cooking with packaged ingredients among both adults and parents. Higher food agency was also associated with higher consumption of vegetables among both adults and children. Food agency encompasses a number of the interrelated factors important for home cooking and is a useful construct for understanding and promoting home cooking behavior.},

Recently, text mining techniques have been rapidly developed for automatically extracting key information from massive text data. Topic modeling, as one of the novel techniques that extracts a thematic structure from documents, is widely used to generate text summarization and foster an overall understanding of the corpus content. Although powerful, this technique may not be directly applicable for general analytics scenarios since the topics and topic\textendash document relationship are often presented probabilistically in models. Moreover, information that plays an important role in knowledge discovery, for example, times and authors, is hardly reflected in topic modeling for comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting a visual analytics system, VISTopic, to help users make sense of large document collections based on topic modeling. VISTopic first extracts a set of hierarchical topics using a novel hierarchical latent tree model (HLTM) (Liu et al., 2014). In specific, a topic view accounting for the model features is designed for overall understanding and interactive exploration of the topic organization. To leverage multi-perspective information for visual analytics, VISTopic further provides an evolution view to reveal the trend of topics and a document view to show details of topical documents. Three case studies based on the dataset of IEEE VIS conference demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights from large document collections.},

  abstract = {As globalization progresses, consumers are readily exposed to many foods from various cultures. The need for studying specialty and unique food products, sometimes known as traditional, authentic, ethnic, exotic, or artisanal foods, is increasing to accommodate consumers' growing demands. However, the number of studies conducted on these types of products with good quality sensory testing is limited. In this review, we analyzed and reviewed sensory and consumer research on specialty and unique food products. Various factors such as manufacturing, processing, or preparation methods of the samples influence the characteristics of food products and their acceptability. Sensory descriptive analysis can be used to distinguish characteristics that highlight these differences, and consumer research is used to identify factors that affect acceptability. Familiarity with product attributes contributes to consumer acceptance. When cross-cultural consumer research is conducted to support product market placement and expansion, sensory descriptive analysis should be conducted in parallel to define product characteristics. This allows better prediction of descriptors that influence consumer acceptability, leading to appropriate product modification and successful introduction.},

However, few studies have been conducted aiming directly at comparing the utility of wine reviews and numeric measurements in wine data analysis. Based on data from close to 300,000 wines reviewed by               Wine Spectator               , we use logistic regression models to investigate whether wine reviews are useful in predicting a wine's quality classification. We group our sample into one of two binary quality brackets, wines with a critical rating of 90 or above and the other group with ratings of 89 or below. This binary outcome constitutes our dependent variable. The explanatory variables include different combinations of numerical covariates such as the price and age of wines and numerical representations of text reviews. By comparing the explanatory accuracy of the models, our results suggest that wine review descriptors are more accurate in predicting binary wine quality classifications than are various numerical covariates\textemdash including the wine's price. In the study, we include three different feature extraction methods in text analysis: latent Dirichlet allocation, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and Doc2Vec text embedding. We find that Doc2Vec is the best performing feature extraction method that produces the highest classification accuracy due to its capability of using contextual information from text documents.

Several programs offer solutions to understand influences and relationships between a descriptive sensory profile and consumer liking, but researchers need to know the (dis)advantages and (dis)similarities of these programs. This study compares the advantages and disadvantages of four statistical software programs and seven multivariate techniques for three empirical studies: milk, paint and fragrance. Internal and external preference mapping are included in this study. No multivariate method consistently generated a high percentage of consumers who mapped closest to their most-liked products. Also, neither the variance nor the complete solution was explained among descriptors and consumers. Of particular interest is that the high percent variance explained in descriptors and/or consumers did not guarantee a preference mean vector that was close to the most-liked product. For uncomplicated data, researchers can use any method/program to create a preference map when consumer data are highly homogenous in product liking patterns. XLSTAT PLS2 (Addinsoft, New York, NY) and Unscrambler PLS2 (passified; CAMO Software Inc., Woodbridge, NJ) are recommended for less homogenous consumer data. For complex heterogeneous data, multidimensional preference analysis is recommended for understanding consumer preference.},

  abstract = {Our experience of flavour involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, and the hedonic evaluation of this complex flavour experience is important in determination of food choice. The appearance of food also generates expectations about food flavour, and past work suggests that these expectations if confirmed enhance the flavour experience. What is less clear is what happens when cues prior to ingestion predict a flavour which is in marked contrast to the actual flavour characteristics. To test this, we conducted three experiments where expectations about food flavour were generated by plausible but inaccurate food labels for a highly novel food, smoked-salmon ice-cream. In Experiment 1, the experience of the food in the mouth generated strong dislike when labelled as ice-cream, but acceptance when labelled as frozen savoury mousse. Labelling the food as ice-cream also resulted in stronger ratings of how salty and savoury the food was than when labelled as a savoury food. Experiment 2 confirmed these findings, and also found that an uninformative label also resulted in acceptable liking ratings. Experiment 3 explicitly tested the effect of labels on flavour expectation, and confirmed that the ice-cream label generated strong expectations of a sweet, fruity flavour, consistent with the visual appearance of the ice-cream, but in marked contrast to the flavour of salty fish. As in Experiments 1 and 2, liking was minimal when the food was tasted after the ice-cream label condition, but liking was acceptable in the other label conditions. These data show that the contrast between expected and actual sensory qualities can result in a strong negative affective response and enhancement of the unexpected sensory qualities.},

Key criteria for a hedonic scale are whether it sensitively and efficiently discriminates among consumer responses to products. Therefore, the key question this study investigates is whether the use of different scales by the same subjects on the same products in a real-world situation would provide different results for the sensory analyst. To address this question, this study comprises the evaluation of 6 for-market varieties each of 4 berries\textemdash raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, and blueberry\textemdash by the same N~=~147 untrained subjects using 3 popular scales\textemdash the 9-pt hedonic scale, the Labeled Affective Magnitude Scale (LAM), and the unstructured Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Data were analyzed by mixed-effects ANOVA with subsequent scale-performance and post-hoc measures, and by bootstrapping simulation studies to estimate the empirical power of each scale to detect differences. For each berry type, significant differences in liking were detected by at least one scale, but scale performance differed. The 9-pt scale was the only one of the three to detect differences among the blueberry samples, and examination of ANOVA and post-hoc results for all berries showed that the 9-pt scale consistently discriminated among samples as well or better than the other two scales. In simulation studies, the 9-pt scale showed reliable detection of differences at sample sizes smaller or equal to the other two scales. It is apparent that\textemdash in terms of real-world applications and expected detection of differences\textemdash the 9-pt scale discriminates consumer liking for different products as well or better than two continuous scales and can be retained in industry research programs.},

The scale was translated into Czech in several systematic steps, piloted and then incorporated into a large quantitative survey, which was carried out between January and April 2021. Data in the survey were collected by a professional research agency, using the IBM Data Collection system. The target population of the study were adults in the Czech Republic. The research sample included 1122 respondents with three quota variables \textendash{} gender, education and age, which reflected the structure of the target population. The analysis demonstrated that food agency is significantly influenced by gender, age, income and marital status. In the context of the Czech Republic, the place of residence (or type of housing) was also identified as an important predictor. The Czech version of the scale confirms its wider applicability outside the US cultural environment.},

In Experiment 2, the participants tasted the solutions and had to discriminate the flavor of solutions that had been colored either `appropriately' or `inappropriately', or else presented as colorless solutions. The participants were explicitly informed that the colors of the solutions provided no useful information regarding the actual flavor identity of the solutions. The participants also rated the flavor intensity of the solutions. The accuracy of participants' flavor discrimination performance was significantly lower when the solutions were colored inappropriately than when they were colored appropriately (or else were presented as colorless solutions).

In the project, 66 cheeses were submitted to quantitative-descriptive sensory analysis (27 descriptors ) and 127 samples aged around 30 days were assessed by trained taste panels. Statistical evaluation of the results, using cluster analysis and non-inferential multivariate techniques, showed that 2 main types of Toma Piemontese could be identified - industrial and artisanal. The industrial type had a high level of standardization and was well accepted by consumers, but tended to have similarities with other cheeses, while the artisanal type had a more original character with a marked flavour, but had frequent defects. It is considered that the 2 types can coexist, each with its own consumer niche. Measures should be taken to make the artisanal cheesemaking process more uniform, and to eliminate the current defects, while retaining the characteristic flavour.},

  abstract = {Abstract Deep learning has been proved to be an advanced technology for big data analysis with a large number of successful cases in image processing, speech recognition, object detection, and so on. Recently, it has also been introduced in food science and engineering. To our knowledge, this review is the first in the food domain. In this paper, we provided a brief introduction of deep learning and detailedly described the structure of some popular architectures of deep neural networks and the approaches for training a model. We surveyed dozens of articles that used deep learning as the data analysis tool to solve the problems and challenges in food domain, including food recognition, calories estimation, quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat and aquatic products, food supply chain, and food contamination. The specific problems, the datasets, the preprocessing methods, the networks and frameworks used, the performance achieved, and the comparison with other popular solutions of each research were investigated. We also analyzed the potential of deep learning to be used as an advanced data mining tool in food sensory and consume researches. The result of our survey indicates that deep learning outperforms other methods such as manual feature extractors, conventional machine learning algorithms, and deep learning as a promising tool in food quality and safety inspection. The encouraging results in classification and regression problems achieved by deep learning will attract more research efforts to apply deep learning into the field of food in the future.},

  abstract = {In economics and other sciences, ``statistical significance'' is by custom, habit, and education a necessary and sufficient condition for proving an empirical result. The canonical routine is to calculate what's called a t-statistic and then to compare its estimated value against a theoretically expected value of it, which is found in ``Student's'' t table. A result yielding a t-value greater than or equal to about 2.0 is said to be ``statistically significant at the 95 percent level.'' Alternatively, a regression coefficient is said to be ``statistically significantly different from the null, p {$<$} .05.'' Canonically speaking, if a coefficient clears the 95 percent hurdle, it warrants additional scientific attention. If not, not. The first presentation of ``Student's'' test of significance came a century ago in 1908, in ``The Probable Error of a Mean,'' published by an anonymous ``Student.'' The author's commercial employer required that his identity be shielded from competitors, but we have known for some decades that the article was written by William Sealy Gosset (1876\textendash 1937), whose entire career was spent at Guinness's brewery in Dublin, where Gosset was a master brewer and experimental scientist. Perhaps surprisingly, the ingenious ``Student'' did not give a hoot for a single finding of ``statistical'' significance, even at the 95 percent level of significance as established by his own tables. Beginning in 1904, ``Student,'' who was a businessman besides a scientist, took an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty, arguing finally that statistical significance is ``nearly valueless'' in itself.},
