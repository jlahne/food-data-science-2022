Welcome! 

This is the repository for the Spring 2022 lectures from the Virginia Tech course FST 5984: SS Data Analytics for Food and Ag Science, taught by [Jacob Lahne, PhD](https://www.fst.vt.edu/aboutus/faculty/jlahne.html).

You'll probably do better to look at the rendered bookdown page, which can be accessed [here](https://jlahne.github.io/food-data-science-2022/).
